So in starting we see an interview is going on <br/> With the title ' The knowledge interview ' <br/> Let's we call the person taking interview A <br/> And the person giving it K <br/> So the interview starts <br/>

A : We welcome you and firstly , how are you? <br/><br/> K : Thanks , I am good and what about you <br/><br/> A : I am also good,, thanks btw for coming,, firstly tell how are you feeling , after reaching so much success in your life <br/><br/> K (little blushes) : thanks for the praise but success is not something it looks like <br/><br/> A : what do you mean <br/><br/> K : I mean one's success can be failure of another and may be success for any 3rd person <br/><br/> A : hmmm, can you tell how <br/><br/> K : I will explain you with an example ,, let 3 persons be A(not you) , B and C <br/> There is a competition <br/> Let A has power to defeat B but will loose from C <br/><br/> And first round is between B and C <br/><br/> Then then success of B is success and A and failure of C whereas <br/> Success success of C is failure of both A and B <br/><br/> A : hmmm nice ,, it means luck plays a major role ,, does it ? <br/><br/> K : yes luck always plays a role but it depends on you hardwork you did <br/><br/> A : how ,, I mean both are correlated,, it's weird to listen <br/><br/> K : yes , but listen how come <br/><br/> So <br/> Take a situation A,B and C <br/> A has done 50% hardwork <br/> Which means A can defeat C <br/> But it depends on luck whether he can fit C or not whereas B and C depends on luck if compete with each other <br/> And if once lost then out of the match <br/> Moreover depends on luck which 2 will first compete together <br/><br/> So if take cases then a total of 4 cases will come and and after adding then you will get probability of 3/4 which means of you have done 50% hardwork then there are 75% chance of your win <br/><br/> So this is how <br/><br/> Whereas if there are 4 persons and A has done 50% hardwork <br/> Which meant he can definitely defeat one of them <br/> Can defeat with probability 3/4 with 2nd of them <br/> And 1/2 probability with 3rd of them <br/><br/> So now there will be 15 cases and on adding them you get probability 75/96 which is around 78% <br/><br/> So now the 3rd case when there are 5 people <br/> You will definitely defeat 2 of them and other 2 depends on luck <br/> Then there will be 64 cases and on adding them you again get 3/4 which means 75 percent <br/><br/> So it's clear that if you have done 50% hardwork then chances of your win is 75%-80% <br/><br/> But remember this is when other players totally depend on luck when played with each other <br/> And when we see the cases in all then you will get to see that it depends on luck that you will win or not <br/><br/> So more hardwork more chance of your win but <br/> Remember luck will have no role of you have done 100% hardwork <br/><br/> A: oh damn , what an explanation, hope are viewers have understood it ,, so tell now do you consider yourself successful or not <br/><br/> K : not completely as I have to do many more <br/><br/> A : what else , you can done while you achieved so much ,, what's your goal then <br/><br/> K : I DON'T KNOW <br/><br/> A : hmmm , so can you tell how you manage all these things together and what should we call you,, <br/> (to viewers )- those who don't know K is a big youtuber , done many researchers in physics and maths , a good singer , and at last writes his own poetries , books and novels <br/><br/> K : I am youtuber by profession as from there I started to earn money <br/> Researches in science and maths are my passion , singing is something close to my heart , which I do for relaxation whereas I write in free spaces <br/><br/> A : what did you just said free spaces , i guess you mean free time <br/><br/> K : no , I mean free spaces only , but it's the time of day which is not empty, can be used , but you mostly waste , it's not the time where you are relaxing , like travelling, bathing, time before getting sleep or something else. I mostly use that time to write <br/><br/> A: Hmmm , but I guess many people don't have this time on regular basis <br/><br/> K : If universe can have empty apeces then why not you <br/><br/> A : wait what ! What do you mean by that <br/><br/> K : it's just a hint I am giving to you and all the viewers ,, think by yourself,, why should I tell everything <br/><br/> A : Ohk ,, then can you tell about empty heart and empty feelings,, cause some people just sometimes feel empty without any reason <br/><br/> K : yes I know,, I also have gone through that face ,, when I was just 18 , for a large period of time,, at least once in a month I went through that empty feeling phase and at that time , the only thing I could do was to cry . It totally depends on you,, from what thing you get satisfaction,, do that ,, or just cry ,, so by this you would fastly get out of the situation <br/><br/> A : ohk ,, i guess it's enough for now ,, so let's end it ,, it was nice meeting you <br/><br/> K(smiles) : same here but wait ,, you asked out many questions from now let's play a game <br/><br/> A : oh wow ,, why not ,, which game <br/><br/> K : guess the golden ball <br/><br/> A : means <br/><br/> K(taking out 2 identical balls from pocket) : these are 2 balls ,, in 2 halves joint by magnet . <br/> One is golden and other is silver from inside ,, I will see what's in that and will push one ball further i.e according to me you should choose that ball for win ,, so you have to decide to choose the golden ball <br/><br/> A : oh that's a nice game ,, I will definitely try <br/> (Looking to camera) : you all also try to guess <br/><br/> K(seeing the balls from inside and pushing one of them ) : so choose <br/><br/> A(taking the unpushed ball) : oh that's silver one but I was expecting it to be golden one <br/><br/> K : Hmmm , I know what you were thinking,, <br/> You thought someone dumb will push silver ball further , you will choose the other ball, the smarter one will push golden one further to confuse you and you know it so you will choose pushed ball , the more smarter one will push silver ball to double confuse you and you think me to be that one so chose unpushed ball and I knew that what you were thinking about me so I pushed golden ball further and so you got tricked <br/><br/> A: damn bro ,, I am out of this game ,, let's end the interview <br/><br/>

So after this interview was over <br/> We see K going home but he was on a cycle <br/> On reaching outer gates he had to place thumb on a device to scan <br/> Further on reaching the main door of house he had to answer few questions to enter the house <br/><br/>

1st question was <br/> there are how many types of universe/ multiverse <br/> He answered : 3 <br/><br/>

2nd question was <br/> Write 69 in terms of binary codes <br/><br/> And 30 seconds times was there <br/> So he fastly wrote 3,7,15,31,63 and then wrote 1000000 then changed it to 1000101 <br/> Then entered and it was correct <br/><br/>

And the 3rd question which appeared <br/> Number of ways to write 18 as sum of any number of consecutive integers <br/> He answered 4 <br/><br/>

And so the gates opened <br/><br/>

( Hey you the readers ,, if want to know the solution/process of any of them ,, message me after completing it) <br/><br/>

After entering the house we see that on entrance there was a sink on right end with a mug to wash hands and on threshold there was area to wash feet through mug <br/> So he did so <br/> And entered the house <br/><br/>

Then we saw that his 4 persons (one girl, 3 boys) came in the hall ,, and ask him about the interview ,, and so K told them whatever happened . <br/><br/> The girl was his wife named paki ,, rest were his friends , best friend Ursh and other 2 : raav and pray <br/><br/>

After a little discussion he entered his room with his wife ,, further she asked so how is your research going on about the empty spaces of universe , <br/><br/> He replied, not really good <br/><br/> We all know everything in this universe is made of atoms and these atoms have some space in between them but what further,, nothing good is coming out but still I will try , <br/><br/>

After eating food he went to his gaming room <br/> Where he earlier played games and made videos <br/> But he does this once a month ,, <br/><br/>

Then we saw he saw time in his advance watch , it was 3:20:45 pushed 3 objects of that room , 1st one revolved 3 times , 2nd one 4 times and 3rd one at 225 degree but nothing happened , so he further rotate it to few more degrees , then an underground path appeared which lead to the basement <br/><br/>

So he entered it ,, further he pressed a button which closed the gates <br/> Further he called hey steve , give the news of the 2 days <br/><br/> Further a robot out of nowhere came out and started speaking some researches which were published everyday from labs of different parts of the world ,, <br/><br/>

Further he started swiping the news on left or right ,, after 10 -15 minutes of this act <br/> A screen got switched on and on that all the news which he had right swiped came on it <br/> Which were also split in the sections of medical, space , war , quantum, inventions , exploration <br/><br/> And he started analysis all of them one by one ,, after an hour later he stopped and pressed 'current topic' which was appearing on that screen <br/><br/>

Further ' empty spaces ' appeared on that in large letters ,, <br/><br/> Further he said " statt discussion " <br/><br/> So steve came and said " yes sir " <br/><br/> K : as already talked about , everything in our universe has atoms and these atoms have space between them <br/><br/> Steve : yes , and these spaces are more or less depending on the type of matter , whether less or more <br/><br/> K : yeah , but are these spaces also made of something just like atoms are made of matter <br/><br/> Steve : antimatter , but according to scientists if matter and antimatter collided then an explosion is for sure <br/><br/> K : yeah but I can't understand that what I am Missing in all these <br/><br/> Steve : you could only find out only if you will think it yourself, <br/><br/>

Further everything was silent , K was just thinking,, being pressure on his mind , analysing all the talks . <br/><br/> And suddenly he said 'a layer ,, may be' <br/><br/> With this he said to Steve , " analysis this all ,, I am going now" <br/><br/> And he went upstairs and out of the basement <br/><br/>

Further to dining table , ate the meal with others , then to his room <br/> Layed down , along his wife was also laying , and a conversation between them started <br/><br/> Aaki : i wanna say something <br/><br/> K : you need not say this line , just say , whatever is in your heart <br/><br/> Aaki : I know , you are doing great things and I really support and appreciate them , but I really miss my original K <br/> I still remember the time where we met after a long time <br/><br/> K : yeah , I too remember we firstly met in 7th and when your left school after 8th we never saw or talked to each other <br/><br/> Aaki : hmmm and after 10 years when my marriage was going on and you were singing there unknowingly just for fun , when everyone was gone and I saw my fionacay cheating on me , and started attacking me when I caught him , you came and saved me <br/><br/> K : i would have done same , even there was someone else in place of you <br/><br/> Aaki : the thing I liked in you ,, and further when I entered this house ,, we first lived as just friends and after 3 years we realised to marry each other ,, <br/><br/> During those 5 years I had seen you like a normal guy with some perfections and some imperfections, but from around last 1 year you have just changed out a day mr. Perfect and the nex kit day .. <br/><br/> K(interrupting her) : no , please no , don't say anything further. <br/><br/> Aaki : okay okay , sorry, I know , you also can't do anything in that , but remember whenever feel you can just cry ,, <br/><br/> And yes I loved you , i love you and will always love you wheather you get changed or not <br/><br/> K : love you too <br/><br/> With this both of them sleeps <br/><br/>

Next morning K was sleeping till late : around 11 am -12 pm : when woke , after refreshing ate breakfast , then got stuck on tv , further started watching reels on internet , moreover even after oily breakfast he started eating chips . Then got sleep which was just at random time <br/><br/>

When woke up again eat (while watching reels) <br/><br/> And while day he was just saying everyone that please do this , please do that <br/><br/> Further he went sleep <br/><br/>

But around 12 am when he felt everyone is asleep , he went to roof top and started crying , punching the walls , and saying, " why God , why " <br/><br/> Repeating this all , and just crying <br/><br/>

Further we saw , Ursh was watching this all from behind and also had tears in his eyes <br/><br/> When K was coming back to stairs , Ursh quickly moved down stairs . <br/><br/>

When Ursh had seen K sleeping , he went to statue of God his their house and started complaining to God ,, saying, " why God , what K bad has done in his life , why he is suffering from this pain , one day mr. Perfect and another day mr. Imperfect . And then at that night regrets that day , cause he wanted to save the day , but totally waste it , please God do something <br/> I can't see him in this condition anymore " <br/><br/>

With this , Ursh went to sleep with tears in his eyes <br/><br/>

Next morning K woke up early , did meditation , then moved out of house for his meetings and so regular day passed <br/><br/>

Now some more days had passed with same routine <br/><br/> So after some days it was going a regular perfect day , he was in his research lab from morning 9 am . <br/><br/> Moving here and there , ordering Steve and finally at evening 6 pm (he didn't ate anything till now) <br/><br/> He published his thesis <br/><br/>

The summary of his thesis was as such <br/><br/> As we know our universe is made of Matter and there are some theories that there are universes that are made of antimatter but he told that as we know there are empty spaces between atoms ,, so according to him these empty spaces are anti matter means that <br/><br/> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br/><br/> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br/><br/> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br/><br/> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br/><br/> Suppose this is a body made of Matter,, <br/> Circles are atoms <br/> So if we remove circles and highlight rest of part , then that is anti matter <br/> And as some theories says if Matter and anti matter collide then there can be blast so according to him there must be a 2d or 3d plate or lining between both of them which would be neutral so named it as 'neutro matter ' inspired from the words neutrons <br/><br/>

He also added some possibilities that how could we enter in it and what would we see in it <br/><br/> And some small details like once he was halusinating and saw something different while seeing moreover listed some glitches present in universe,, connecting them to his thesis <br/><br/>

So finally he published it on his website where he also patent his thesis <br/><br/> And finally his thesis was open to the world <br/><br/> He was so much happy and excited after a long time he came out and told his friends and wife that finally he had done his research,, (having smile on his face) <br/><br/>

He hugged everyone,, Everyone was making a little weird face <br/><br/> But his wife was still smiling but it was like she is holding her tears and said ," great work , let me bring sweets" saying this she went to kitchen with some tears in her eyes <br/><br/>

When K asked everyone about their weird face <br/> Then Ursh answered in a sad tone ," bro , you forgot, today was her birthday" <br/><br/> K : oh shit , how could I <br/><br/>

K quickly went to kitchen hugged paki , wished her , sayed sorry again and again <br/><br/> Paki stopped him and said ,"it's ok , if you forgot that today was my birthday,, but you know what from past many days I am just feeling you forget me " <br/><br/> Listening this K moved back <br/><br/> Paki : I don't needed any gift but I really need you , your time <br/><br/>

K : so sorry , i agree I am wrong but <br/><br/>

Paki : don't say anything , I know from what you are going through , I am saying this all because you completed your research and I had decided if today also you were like earlier i wouldn't say a single line to you ,, but making you realize that we all ,, your family,, needs you without any need ,, we love you and are Missing you ,, you really need to make balance,, at last from tomorrow if you follow your daily routine i wouldn't have a single complain , i will always stand with you whenever you will need . <br/><br/>

Saying this she went to room <br/><br/>

Next day when he woke up he saw many negative comments of his thesis, most were making fun of that , some were blaming him that it is copied and others doing something else ,, only a small percent was supporting him , his years of reputation got broke with this <br/><br/>

He saw videos where some of his ideal scientists were saying that he is just wrong and impractical without and making fun of him <br/><br/> Some of people from different religion raging at him that if his thesis was true then any sign of that must been given in holy books of their respective religion <br/><br/>

He started calling many people who he supposed to support him , but no one picked up his call <br/><br/> He locked the room <br/><br/>

Paki , Ursh , raav and pray were seeing all the responses <br/><br/>

Further When raav moved to K's room felt that it was locked , he knocked it , started beating shouting to make k open it <br/><br/>

But K from inside replied,"no" <br/><br/>

Hearing the noice all came and asked what happened <br/><br/> Raav told them every thing and they started pushing the door , making it break <br/><br/>

As They entered they saw K sitting on a corner, head down and crying <br/><br/>

They all moved to him , consoled him , gave water , <br/><br/>

K : I was doing all of this for improvement in human race but this human race became against me , i lost connections from you all for while world , and this world made me lost from life ,, what wrong i had done <br/><br/>

They took him to the hall <br/><br/>

Tried to making him stop crying but again K started crying <br/><br/>

Further K looking at paki <br/> Said , " i forgot your birthday , still you didn't blamed me ,, please scold me or beat me , i actually deserve this , I am so stupid that for others i forgot you " <br/><br/>

Ursh(in a loud voice ): no K , you have done nothing wrong, yes you forgot her birthday, but this was just a small mistake, we can't ignore that before this year you made all of us feel so special each day wheather the day was ordinary or special <br/> So if everyone is making fun of you , then it's their fault ,, not yours Please don't blame yourself, i request <br/><br/>

Rest of 3 also agreed with Ursh <br/><br/>

K : love you all ,, from now I am totally yours ,, may all other go to hell <br/><br/>

Interval 1 <br/><br/>
 <br/>
 
 <h1 className='text-center font-bold'>EMPTY SPACES PART-2</h1>
 <br />

    So after speaking this ,, all of them went to sleep , so the next K called everyone in hall ,, and spoke <br/><br/>

Now what should I do ,, if made videos like earlier, I may get views and money but with negative comments only , my whole reputation ruined,, people started picking my smallest mistake,, my smallest wrong words and many manipulated videos are viral on internet,, of course I have a true audience,, which cared , but it's a small number,, coming next , no one will call me for any interview, podcast or any Collab of for any singing show <br/><br/>

Next is literature part , yes I could do that ,, but they also don't guarantee the money <br/><br/>

Paki : you need not earn much money we will manage everything <br/><br/>

Ursh : yes , and as you want to do work , you may write and upload it ,, no need to read comments ,, for YouTube,, upload gaming videos ,, no need to read comments,, we will give you honest review about them <br/><br/>

Raav : and music is thing you do from heart ,, no need to show it to others <br/><br/>

K : sounds good ,, let's try this life now , but wait let me meet you with someone <br/><br/>

Saying this K went to his gaming room ,, came after a little while <br/><br/>

Whistled and said " hey steve come " <br/><br/>

Thus,, saying this <br/> Steve the robo appeared in front of everyone <br/><br/>

K told everyone about him and the things he could do ,, moreover k also said to everyone that don't consider him as a robot but as my friend <br/> He may help you all with your works ,, a little help of him can make your work easier,, but just don't be dependent on him <br/><br/>

Saying this , K went to his gaming room ,, recorded a video ,, and uploaded <br/><br/>

Further playing guitar and then continuing his novel <br/><br/>

Meanwhile others went to their work <br/><br/>

But Paki and Ursh were facing very high problems ,, as they were close to K so people were not accepting them to work with them <br/><br/>

The thing happened was that <br/><br/>

As Ursh was businessman,, he went for a deal , but the party made insult of him and left ,, <br/> Whereas paki, who worked in a research department was fired due to public pressure <br/><br/>

On other hand raav who was a doctor and has his own hospital,, in his hospital number of patients were less as compared to every day <br/><br/> And those who came and saw him went back <br/><br/>

So he had to move back to home <br/><br/>

Coming next to pray who worked as CA in a big company was not being well treated from colleagues <br/><br/>

When raav came back home ,, so early, K asked the reason but raav told a lie that there was no emergency case , other doctors said that they will manage , so I came back <br/><br/>

Raav also asked k that was he doing till now <br/><br/>

K told him about the 3 things he did and further he was surfing internet to know why he is getting so much hate <br/><br/>

As this much hate can't be just because of a simple hypothesis <br/><br/>

Raav : so what result did you get <br/><br/>

K : let everyone come <br/><br/>

After some time firstly paki and then Ursh came <br/><br/>

They honestly told what had happened <br/><br/> K was tensed but not in shock <br/><br/>

K : hmmm , i guess I know the reason but let's wait for pray <br/><br/>

At evening pray came , he also hide the truth <br/><br/>

So after pray got refreshed <br/><br/> Everyone gathered in K's room <br/><br/>

K showed them some videos and articles published <br/><br/>

The 1st video stated that his thesis is violating some religious sentiments but it was seeming pointless to him as it said that according to some scriptures multiverse exist and they are far away from earth and people need to go out their universe, moreover some ruthless negative debate on the possibilities he gave <br/><br/>

Next video showed that how arrogant he is and how down he can go <br/><br/>

As it was shown that some years back once someone made parody video on his friendship which he didn't liked so he made a constructive criticism video on that which didn't spread hate at all but the thing he was unaware was that on some other app , which he didn't knew about, some of his toxic fans started giving hate to the creator who made parody video , and making morphed images of that creator <br/><br/>

The next video showed that recently he had given few minutes at a random interview at road where he said a positive thing but started it with a sarcasm so in that video only the sarcasm part was shown <br/><br/>

And number of these videos were just going more and more <br/><br/>

Coming next to some articles where a total negative life style of K was shown <br/><br/> That how in name of friendship he is just making emotional dramas and also that his love was fake and had done marriage just for his profit and many more his good habits were shown in a bad way <br/><br/>

After showing these things to everyone <br/><br/>

K : now something which I can see is that this is totally planned , someone who is powerful wants to downgrade me <br/> But who , why and what did he gain <br/><br/>

Next the scene we could see was that <br/><br/>

In a room 7 people were there in which one scientist and one mathematician whom K consider as idle ,, 3rd one was leader of biggest mafia of Asia , 4th one was a business man whom very few people knew about as his income was hidden from the world , 5th one of the politician from Russia and 2 of the remaining whose description was not given were sitting at the front <br/><br/>

It was being discussed that , their plan to destroy K is going well <br/><br/>

Then mathematician said that : I was seeing him from a long time , he wasn't stopping, he was telling the truth , the things we couldn't solve were being solved by him <br/><br/>

Scientist : yes , after listening to his theories , I concluded that they are right <br/><br/>

Business man : so that's why you both wanted to destroy him so that your respective teams can gave results to public ,, timely <br/><br/>

Mafia leader : let me handle him , I will kill him the moment you say <br/><br/>

Politician : he is trapped, and now can't escape <br/><br/>

Front person 1 : no need to take his life <br/><br/>

Front person 2 : just destroy him completely <br/><br/>

Coming back to the home scene of K <br/><br/>

K : whoever it is , wants me to destroy completely, he will do anything , will not care , and has no limits <br/><br/>

Paki : then what now <br/><br/>

K : you all just chill ,, I will handle this , but wait ... <br/><br/>

After a little conversation everyone get back to their rooms and slept <br/><br/>

Further came the next day <br/><br/>

It was going very simple <br/><br/> Everyone is engaged in something or else <br/><br/> And K is cooking food for everyone and listening music <br/><br/>

Suddenly paki came in very stressed mode <br/><br/> K stopped the music and asked her , what happened <br/><br/>

Paki : I started reading newspaper , and the first news I saw was that 1 bank got scammed, someone took crores as loan and got out of the country, another bank , the trustees of the bank , taking whole money from bank , got out of the country and another bank got robbed just yesterday and these are the 3 banks in which our mostly money was stored , <br/><br/>

On your earlier suggestion we put our money in different banks instead of one , as if one faces any issue then we must have some savings <br/><br/> But here all 3 ,, <br/><br/>

Moreover how the news came collectively <br/> It should have been one by one <br/><br/>

K : wait wait wait , don't panic , we will definitely get out of the situation <br/><br/>

Suddenly Ursh appeared <br/><br/>

Ursh (in surprised tone) : i lost my all business , recently I had a big project which was to be further delivered to public, but when it was delivering, someone burnt everything, my all trucks , <br/><br/>

I had to pay a large amount, which got away from my bank account, despite public has a large anger on me that I scammed them , i can't understand what just happened. <br/><br/>

Raav : I have 2 bad news one that my hospital was raided , 2nd place where pray worked suffered a mass firing in which 17 people got died and 7 people are injured <br/><br/>

Suddenly pray appeared <br/><br/>

Pray : thanks to you K you advised me to resign in yesterday's end discussion, otherwise <br/><br/>

Raav : yes , your predictions were so accurate, as you said yesterday night , I sent my some trusted people to my hospital to check everything completely and we got fake equipments and some fake patients with drugs <br/><br/> So in night only we called police and so in morning nothing wrong happend <br/><br/>

Ursh : but what should I do , despite I have some money left , due to your yesterday's advise I sold all my shares , as my account was blocked today morning by the app owners , but people have a large anger on me <br/><br/>

K : for now best solution is to sell your company, but don't do it till I say to do , moreover you know more than me , in this field , so you have more chances to get better idea , but please tell it to me <br/><br/>

Ursh : hmmm , every problem has solution <br/><br/>

Paki : And what about us , only a month would be survived from the savings in our all other banks , despite we control everything , how would basic expenses be managed . <br/><br/>

K : do you really think I never thought of this situation,, from the day our money started growing in our banks , <br/> I was saving cash in the basement , despite It is not as much as in our banks , but it is enough for many months , if we will do everything in control. <br/><br/> But first think how could we get out of whole situation , because till now we don't know who is all behind this , and most dangerous thing is that , he knows everything about us . <br/><br/>

Ursh : Then what should be out priority <br/><br/>

K : listen all , we have 2 choices <br/> 1st one , keep quite , do nothing, keep hiding, for few months , after that do something normal work and live the life <br/><br/> 2nd one , think something, so that we could get out of this situation, firstly convert public's hate to love again and then everything would get nice <br/><br/>

Everyone altogether said , "of course, 2nd one" <br/><br/>

K : so go and think some idea , in your own way <br/><br/>

With this K went to his room and started playing guitar <br/><br/>

Ursh went to roof top in cool breeze , sitting and thinking <br/><br/>

Paki blindfolded herself <br/> And started thinking in different positions, standing on one leg , head stand or something else <br/><br/>

Raav started meditating <br/><br/>

And Pray Started lifting dumbbells present in his room <br/><br/>

After 2 hrs all met , with their idea , <br/><br/>

Ursh : i guess I must sell the company asap and give the total amount to people <br/><br/>

Paki : instead take help of media , I have some of my trusted friends in media who would display whatever you want to say , truly <br/><br/>

Raav : do you have some contacts to whom public would listen <br/><br/>

Pray : i will just say honesty is the best policy <br/><br/>

K : firstly I want to gather some proofs of Many things , Paki , call your friends, I will face everyone , Ursh , say your decision in front of everyone and now I will call 2 of my friends , not close as you all , but the level of trust is totally High , <br/><br/>

Ursh : who <br/><br/>

K : cheg and vay both are literally awesome, highly successful in their life , cheg one of the best engineers , and vay after doing simple job for some time , didn't stopped , did business , a professional hacker and now has everything he wanted , dreamed off and really deserved , I will call them asap <br/><br/>

Further K went to his room , took his phone , searched their names in contact and send SOS code to both of them and sent location <br/><br/>

Within some hours both of them arrived (they didn't knew each other) <br/><br/>

K went out and took them in , after coming inside K introduced everyone to eachother <br/><br/> Then they asked what happened <br/><br/>

Raav said to k," didn't you told what had happened" <br/><br/>

K : I only sent an SOS code according to which genuine it's a need and you need to come <br/><br/>

Raav : oh damn ,, nice <br/><br/>

Cheg : so tell what happened <br/><br/>

K : not here , come to the roof <br/><br/>

All 3 went to the the roof <br/><br/>

Then K told both of them the whole story <br/><br/>

After completing, k hugged both of them and said , " thanks for coming , only on a single SOS code without even knowing the matter" <br/><br/>

Vay : no need bro , please don't do the formalities , just tell what can we do for you , despite sitting beside you in the conference <br/><br/>

K : you know what allegations are on me , find way with help of your skills to disprove them <br/><br/>

Cheg : ok , give us time , we would find some way out <br/><br/>

K : you can take the laptop if needed <br/><br/>

Vay : I have mine <br/><br/>

Cheg : I forgot to carry, yes give it please <br/><br/>

So after the discussion all went down and started doing the things they could do <br/><br/>

One room was given to both of them , meanwhile others were to do their respective works , <br/><br/> Like K had planned to gather some more proofs of his thesis , he was also working on that , <br/><br/>

Now it was night , cheg and vay came out , while others were on sofa , discussion something, then said, " we have a very interesting presentation for you all guys , if K gave this is the conference he would definitely get out of public anger , then both of them showed their work to them <br/><br/>

K : really impressive , the things I couldn't found out , you did so easily <br/><br/>

Cheg : main role is of vay , as he knew hacking , he found out your real videos , and some names which I will tell you further but the names would be within we 3 , till the conference <br/><br/>

K : alright <br/><br/>

Raav : but why <br/><br/>

K : no questions , please bro , if he is saying that then their must be a valid reason <br/><br/>

Pray : I want to ask something , don't mind , neither take it otherwise, but if cheg and vay did the things without coming here , everything would be discussed online , then it would have saven a lot time , and their efforts, please don't take me wrong, I am happy , they came , you met but <br/><br/>

Cheg : no need to clarify your question , you are absolutely right but <br/><br/>

K : yeah , but what If the talk we do is being tapped , our enemy would know our plan , moreover <br/><br/>

Vay : it was was for our security purpose also , we are helping him so .. <br/><br/>

Pray: ok i understand, good decision <br/><br/>

K : so a day after tomorrow we could have the conference <br/><br/>

Paki : we could do it Tommorow only , i want to get out of this , asap <br/><br/>

K : I know , but a little work is to be done , please , <br/><br/>

Paki : okk , fine <br/><br/>

So the next day came <br/><br/>

In the morning K was busy in the basement , after some hours he came and said to all , " I am ready , let me fix the conference for tomorrow , but where is Ursh " <br/><br/>

Paki : you didn't told that you were in basement , <br/><br/>

K : i guessed , you would have understood that if I am not in house then must be in my place, why didn't you called me <br/><br/>

Paki (little nervous): few hours back a call came to Ursh , we didn't listened it , but he told that you are calling him somewhere, so he went. <br/><br/> Despite we said that any of us can come with him , but he told that you had callen him specially <br/><br/>

K : oh noooo , this is a trap , I need to go , Vay find Ursh's location, give it to me and paki , set Tomorrow's conference, I will come with him by Tommorow , I am leaving <br/><br/>

So k went , it was night , but no one came , <br/><br/>

Suddenly Ursh came , everyone asked him about k , he was shocked , and said , " I don't know , what happened" <br/><br/>

Paki : first, you tell where were you , as we know K didn't called you <br/><br/>

Ursh : yes , it was a trap, actually the thing happened was that , a call came someone said that they have kidnapped K , they even showed his voice , still when I wasn't sure they did video call where k was with them in chains, still I did a call on K's phone, it was dead , then they said me to come at their location alone , so I went , lying to you all <br/><br/>

Then paki told him everything happened after he left <br/><br/>

Ursh : yes , When I went the location was again and again Changing, even my phone became dead , after some hours i came to realise the enemy ' s plan and so came back in hurry, but it was cause of me , k is missing <br/><br/>
Paki : please don't blame yourself, I am worried , had something bad happened to him , no no no , i shouldn't even think so <br/><br/>

Ursh : yes please don't , i know k would be fine , he can't be trapped , he would have knew enemy's plan , and would come soon <br/><br/>

Paki : I hope so <br/><br/>

Ursh : what about the conference <br/><br/>

Paki : I fixed it for Tommorow, shall I cancel it <br/><br/>

Ursh : no , if k said he would come then he would definitely come <br/><br/>

No one slept next night , everyone was waiting for K <br/><br/>

From night to morning, then to conference time , K didn't came , <br/><br/>

Reporter : where is K , we would only talk to him , if he is not present, we don't want to listen any of you <br/><br/>

Ursh : he will come , he said that , so he would definitely come , please wait . <br/><br/>

Much time went but K didn't came and reporters went back <br/><br/>

Everything came to end reputation of K had totally gone <br/><br/>

But the question still lies where K is ?? <br/><br/>
