                    So at last we saw K came from smoke and said that they won<br />

                    <br />

                    So further<br />

                    <br />

                    After saying that<br />

                    Paki, Ursh , raav and pray hugged him and said let's go<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : but what happened to both of the heads<br />

                    <br />

                    K : they apologized and promised that they would not do such things in future<br />

                    <br />

                    Further<br />

                    They went back through the doors<br />

                    Picked up bodies of vay and cheg<br />

                    Went to the car<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : Ursh, how do you know everything about K even things I don't know<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : cause I knew him when we were 3 , despite the fact that we were apart for a few years but I know very well what his  interests are,, but what are you talking about?<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : what is K actually scared off?<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : leave it for now, you will know when the right time will come,, for now relax, we won<br />

                    <br />

                    K(sad voice) : but at what cost, I lost 2 of my friends<br />

                    <br />

                    All were now quite<br />

                    <br />

                    So further they all reached home<br />

                    <br />

                    K : Can any of you call their wives ,, cause I will not be able to do so,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : ok,, I will do<br />

                    <br />

                    Then she called them,, just asked them to come, not telling the truth<br />

                    <br />

                    When both arrived she showed them the bodies  ,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Both were shocked,, fell down at their knees , crying,<br />

                    <br />

                    Wife of vay :  how did that happen,, why the hell K didn't save him<br />

                    <br />

                    Wife of cheg : he always talked about K,, his friendship,, where the hell that friendship went ,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : we are sorry for your loss,, and can never pay off but still if you want any type of help for the rest of your  whole life  ,,  can call / ask anytime and any number of times,,<br />

                    This is not a pay off, but just a little thing we can only do,<br />

                    <br />

                    Further funeral happened<br />

                    <br />

                    While their bodies were burning<br />

                    <br />

                    K came in front fell on knees,, started crying,<br />

                    <br />

                    K : why, why you left me,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki came,, supported him<br />

                    <br />

                    Wife of vay(crying and shouting) : don't do overacting,, you must have saved him<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki was about to say something but K stopped her<br />

                    <br />

                    For now everyone went back to home<br />

                    <br />

                    Wives of vay and cheg also went back to their respective house<br />

                    <br />

                    At night<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : let's go to sleep<br />

                    <br />

                    K : please you go,, I will come later<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : ok,, I will not force<br />

                    <br />

                    Next day<br />

                    <br />

                    Everyone saw K was sleeping on the sofa,,<br />

                    <br />

                    None of them disturbed him<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : isn't it  weird, cause he never slept so long<br />

                    <br />

                    Yes when he lived life one day perfectly and other imperfectly, he slept till late on the imperfect day,, but the time is more than that,, moreover, from the day he  faced the backslash,, he was normal,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : maybe he slept very late<br />

                    <br />

                    Raav : yes,, don't worry<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : Ok,, if you say<br />

                    <br />

                    After some time K woke up<br />

                    <br />

                    K : hello guys,, actually I wasn't able to sleep last night,, I..<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : no need to explain further,, we know,,<br />

                    <br />

                    K gave a small smile then back to normal<br />

                    <br />

                    K : So,, what is today's plan<br />

                    <br />

                    Pray : I will go back to my job from Tomorrow, so was preparing everything<br />

                    <br />

                    Raav : and me to my hospital ,<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : I have decided not to go back to that research Center,, I will continue as a private,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : I guess this is only me,, who is confused,,<br />

                    <br />

                    K : me too ,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Pray : that's why you are best friends<br />

                    <br />

                    With that , after a long time everyone laughed a little<br />

                    <br />

                    From day to night happened<br />

                    <br />

                    So after dinner everyone went back to their rooms<br />

                    <br />

                    K : let's sleep,, I am feeling very sleepy<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki: ok ok<br />

                    <br />

                    But the next morning when paki woke she saw K was not beside her,, when she looked here and there, she saw K sleeping on the chair,,<br />

                    <br />

                    After some hours when K woke up<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : why were you on the chair<br />

                    <br />

                    K : actually, I woke up in the middle of sleep,, so I decided to read after reading a little I decided to take a break despite the book being interesting , my eyes were a little tired so I sat on the chair and closed my eyes for a minute,, then when I got sleep,, I couldn't know<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : oh ok,,<br />

                    <br />

                    As such pray and raav were gone to their work places<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki also went to her own office,, which she took on rent,, it was a small place where she kept all the materials,, moreover the rent was not much,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Whereas at home when K came outside, he was seeing the sky,, while doing that he got unconscious<br />

                    <br />

                    After some minutes when Ursh was finding K  , he couldn't see him anywhere and after a little search,, he came outside, saw K, rushed towards him,, took him inside , put on the bed, called raav<br />

                    <br />

                    After some time raav came , ge checked K,, told that nothing serious he is just unconscious,,<br />

                    <br />

                    While he said this paki too came<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : what, what happened ,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Raav : don't worry, he will recover in some minutes, just bring some juice for him<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki went quickly, made the juice and put it in mouth of K<br />

                    <br />

                    After some minutes K woke up<br />

                    <br />

                    Raav : as I said, his mind was somewhat confused,, so the juice gave power to brain,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : why were you confused<br />

                    <br />

                    K : I was confused what to do , as I talked earlier<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : what,, really<br />

                    <br />

                    With that again night came<br />

                    <br />

                    K : paki, you sleep, I will go to my gaming room,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Saying this he went to his gaming room<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki further knocked at Ursh's door<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh  : what happened,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : I guess you were right,, K is really acting a little weird,, from 3-4 nights, he never spent any night with me,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Even when he lived perfect and imperfect life, rather for a small time we oftenly did some romantic talks, but now..<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : oooh, romantic talks (giggles)<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : I am serious<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : ok ok,, I know,, yes you are right, something is actually weird,, just sleep for now,, we will think tomorrow about that,, and if possible then make plan to know the truth<br />

                    <br />

                    Cause either something is making K all do this<br />

                    Or K is possessed by someone or he is not our K<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : what<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : I was just thinking about possibilities,, don't worry,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : hmmm,, i know this can't be true as the locks can only be opened by K but<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : but what?<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : there is one more thing,, I always came to know while K is near me or not and so is happening but the essence is really different,, like same same but different<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : hmm I see , I guess we need to find what has happened to him<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : yes, a plan is really needed, let's sleep for now, will think tomorrow about it<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : as you say<br />

                    <br />

                    Next morning ,  paki found K sleeping on his gaming chair , she quickly went to tell ursh that again K didn't spend the night with her<br />

                    <br />

                    After some time K woke up and came outside<br />

                    <br />

                    K : hello guys, I guess today I am not late enough<br />

                    <br />

                    Raav : yeah, we are about to go<br />

                    <br />

                    Pray :  at least better than yesterday<br />

                    <br />

                    K smiled a little and said : soon I will be back to normal<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : yeah,, don't tease him pray and raav, and K it's time,, so I am too leaving,, bye bye<br />

                    <br />

                    K : bye<br />

                    <br />

                    After everyone left<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : Hey K, shall we go out somewhere,, it's been a great time since we went somewhere together<br />

                    <br />

                    K : yeah, but where can we go<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : your favourite destination?<br />

                    <br />

                    K : you mean park?<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : yeah,, the park where we played together in childhood<br />

                    <br />

                    K : Ok,, come<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : will you drive, I am a little not in the mood to drive today,, or if you say I will drive while we come back,<br />

                    <br />

                    After thinking a little<br />

                    <br />

                    K : ok,<br />

                    <br />

                    Then after a long drive both of them reached a park which was big enough and also had swings , slides,  monkey baars and some more<br />

                    But no children,, only adults, may be the cause of afternoon time, yet the weather was cloudy and windy<br />

                    <br />

                    After they both entered<br />

                    <br />

                    K : let's go to the see-saw, it's been long time<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : who are you,,<br />

                    <br />

                    K : what<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : I asked who are you,, as I know you are not K<br />

                    <br />

                    K : what do you mean, I am K, I am living with you from a long time, even I passed all the security checks, which I put just in case someone else in my disguise came<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : I know that, you cleared all the checks,, but if you were real you would have known that we never played together in childhood,, except in school playground<br />

                    <br />

                    K then stepped back as ursh was scolding and moving further but Paki came from that side<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : stop , you have to tell, who are you and where is real K<br />

                    <br />

                    K : what , haven't you left for<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : it was just a small plan,,<br />

                    <br />

                    K : oh, but why are you not understanding that, I am real K, why the hell are you doubting, it was just a misunderstanding that I thought ursh was talking about this only, as he said where we played,, and I always consider myself as like a child , I knew very well that we lived little away so could never play together,<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : oh, really, then answer a question, why the hell one of the heads said that, they are also heroes like you<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : not that then tell me why I didn't get married till now<br />

                    <br />

                    K : some people just consider them as heroes, despite whatever they do and you aren't married cause of me<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : do you really think, you are right,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : then tell,, what is the glitch in the machine<br />

                    <br />

                    Now he became little nervous ,,<br />

                    <br />

                    K : ok ok ok wait,, let me tell you ,, but first let's go home, or somewhere no one else is there, as I don't want that by any chance anyone else listen to this, moreover K has a reputation so<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki then whistled aloud and with that everyone present in the park went outside,, park was now empty and silent,, just the voice of breeze was there<br />

                    <br />

                    Then the person saying himself aa K came on knees, a little down the head<br />

                    <br />

                    Disguised person : firstly let me clear you that I am K, the only reason I could open all the security levels<br />

                    But I am not your K,, I am K from the parallel universe<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : oh wait, K told us about that,, oh you are that K<br />

                    <br />

                    K ' : yes<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh then made him stand again<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : but why should we believe you<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : but paki, there were only us, K , K' and his team,, we will call you K' just don't mind,, who knew about this parallel universe concept<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : hmmm, K'  then tell us something about that universe that K never wrote in his thesis<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : I remember that K told me that he never expected that my universe may move from death to life,, night to day,, which was the reason, I felt unconscious<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : ok ok I believe you but tell me where my K is and why the hell you not told the truth earlier<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : I don't know where he is but I thought less the people knew about my reality better for the the multiverse stability<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : I guess K met your team and so now you meet us,, stability,, but when did you got replaced?<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : I wasn't sure of that, and the place where we got replaced  ,, you remember your last battle where both the heads , mathematician and scientist were there,, I guess the machine was switched on here too, like in my world, so I teleported here,, and I saw K was lifeted a little in air both the heads were on knees,, and K spared there life, as they asked for sorry, and so they went quickly,, but as such K got unconscious, but suddenly a light splashed into my eyes and when it got off K was not there, this all happened within the time smoke was present,, so I decided for the time being I will be K,, as I had to live in this world,, and find K the enemies and the machine so that I could go back,, but for that i had to blend with you guys, but you guys caught me<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : that means K can be in your universe and you got caught because you acted so suspicious,, not spending the nights with paki<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : Ursh, please,, be serious<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : no,, only one person can travel ,, and if it happened, I would never have seen him<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : May be due to the glitch K was<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : wait a second,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Further K' moved towards paki again got on knees and held his ears<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : if you want to give any punishment, I am ready to take, as you are K's wife and anything wrong could have happened,, so to maintain your dignity I never spent the nights and just focused on understanding this universe,, but still I am really sorry<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki made him stand up<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : no need to do that,, despite you aren't K but you too have a good and strong character like him,, I guess it's time to go back<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : yeah<br />

                    <br />

                    Then all 3 went back to home,,<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : would tell the truth to raav and pray<br />

                    <br />

                    Ursh : I already said, your full team knows the truth so..<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : ok ok, but, no one else please<br />

                    <br />

                    Paki : of course<br />

                    <br />

                    When raav and pray came home everything was told to them<br />

                    <br />

                    Raav : did it mean that K is trapped by the heads<br />

                    <br />

                    K' : I don't know,,<br />

                    <br />

                    Coming to the enemy base scene where it was whole dark and both of them were sitting around a table on 2 chairs<br />

                    <br />

                    Head 1 : how the hell we lost from a normal guy<br />

                    <br />

                    Head 2 : and how our attacks weren't working<br />

                    <br />

                    Head 1 : I guess our hardwork of so many years was just vain<br />

                    <br />

                    Suddenly 2 voices came<br />

                    <br />

                    Unknown 1 : you are not defeated yet,, you are still alive<br />

                    <br />

                    Unknown 2 : accept that your enemy is really way too powerful,, just use your full potential<br />

                    <br />

                    Unknown 1 : head 1 , you have control over all the HCMs<br />

                    <br />

                    Unknown 2 : head 2 , you have control over almost all the cults use them and destroy your enemies<br />

                    <br />

                    Head 1 : who the hell are you ,, remove your mask,,<br />

                    <br />

                    With this part 1 ends,, and the question is still there, who are these 2 guys,, and most importantly where is K ? Let's see in part 2<br />

                    <br />

                    ..... to be continued<br />

                    <br />

                    Interval 1
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>PART-2</h2>

                <p>
                    So at last we saw 2 unknowns,, reminding heads their power,, whereas truth was also told to raav and pray<br />
                    <br />
                    So after after that<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : oh that's why, wife of vay was saying don't overact,, as you didn't have emotions with these cheg and vay<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : but,, he could have shown real as he too has his own cheg and vay<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : guys,, let me also speak,, actually I don't know who are cheg and vay<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone together : whattt<br />
                    <br />
                    K' :  did you forget,, in my universe person appears from death ,, which means,, they had to soon exist and then I would meet them,, then ..<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh yeah,, when k was telling everything happened there,, he never talked about cheg and vay, maybe he didn't notice that they were not present<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : damn,, it's too complicated,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : so what's next ? I mean is our next mission to find K or something else?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : of course,, we have to find him,, but is he really trapped with the enemies,, as K' told that a flash hit his eyes when K disappeared ,, and the enemies had already left the place,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : maybe they came back,, saw that K was unconscious,,did the flash,, took him<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : I also need to find K and the machine as only in presence of both I would be able to go back,, and by this I am not saying that I don't care K,, I am just clearing myself,, and my need if anyone doubts<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : ok ok,, let's move to the bases,, K' you go to the arena base where K fought,, raav and pray , you go to 2nd base where we used the machine to call K back<br />
                    And I and Ursh will go to the very first base,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Coming to enemies scene<br />
                    <br />
                    The 2 unknowns came towards the heads,, showing them their faces,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1 : what! Am I seeing a reflection,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 2 : damn,, it means you are us from the parallel Multiverse<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1' : yess despite I know you lost all your team but if the power of we 4 combines , then none can beat us,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 2' : yess,, send your hcm, to destroy them if not enough then use the power of all the cults<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 2 : but that was the last choice<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1 : I guess earlier we misunderstood the potential of K , we need to use our full potential<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 2 : but wait I forgot to ask,, how did you come here<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 2' : firstly you must know everything about our universe<br />
                    <br />
                    After explaining everything<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1' : do you remember you punched K with the special tool ,, and he switched on the machine<br />
                    <br />
                    Same thing happened in our universe but due to this an auro was created within K, and you both,, same in our universe so we all travelled ,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 2 : that means K of your universe has also came here<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1' : yes,, and yes please tell which phase you used?<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1 : of course phase 1 , but not the special merged one of that phase<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1' : now send from phase 2,3,4 ,, not all , but those which are powerful<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1 : phase 3 has only 1 powerful i.e hcm 008<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1' : hmmm, the sandrax and he is max  powerful in the desert area ,, so I guess send hcm 521 from phase 2 and hcm 280 from phase 4<br />
                    <br />
                    Head 1 : that's right<br />
                    <br />
                    On other side<br />
                    <br />
                    As paki was advising the tasks,, bases everyone will go<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : do you really think they would be on same base till now,, they are ultra rich,, they must have many bases,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : but maybe we will find some clue<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : I guess K' is right, and I don't think so they repeat the same mistake of giving us clues<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : does anyone have any other thing we can do,, we don't have any option, just to raid the bases<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : yes and maybe they unintentionally left some clue,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : that seems ok,, let's move<br />
                    <br />
                    When everyone moved outside they saw 2 monsters in front of them<br />
                    <br />
                    One of them with the face of a vulture , wings and claws but body was metal<br />
                    <br />
                    And other a tiger,, standing,, with branches of tree coming out from his chest<br />
                    <br />
                    They attacked them<br />
                    <br />
                    HCM 521 - attacked with a wind slash and all of them except Ursh fell down at their position,,<br />
                    <br />
                    HCM 280 - punched at ground and the earth started getting open,, but all of them dodged<br />
                    <br />
                    HCM- 521 - then attacked by making a tornado,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh ran inside the house and quickly brought something in bucket with lid<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : give me cover<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav and pray gave him cover so that he could move near to HCM 521<br />
                    <br />
                    But got stuck in tornado<br />
                    <br />
                    While he was swirling he got a glimpse of K<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : are you not scared of natural disasters<br />
                    <br />
                    K : like ?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : like tornado, earthquake<br />
                    <br />
                    K: tornado is way too easy, just go to eye of the tornado<br />
                    <br />
                    As ursh remembered it so he tried and with a hardwork he reached the eye of tornado<br />
                    <br />
                    It was too calm there and he could see HCM 521 clearly,,<br />
                    <br />
                    He poured it liquid in bucket at him,, HCM 521 then fell down on knees<br />
                    <br />
                    Further ursh sent a wind thrower invented by K at him,, it was like a fan, which was creating high pressure on HCM 521<br />
                    <br />
                    Within some minutes it screamed very high and its head got bursted out meanwhile tornado also stopped<br />
                    <br />
                    HCM - 280 then quickly attacked ursh and ursh flew high in air while he was in air he screamed ' ultrasound'<br />
                    <br />
                    But sadly he hit the boundary wall of the house and got fainted<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki moved towards him trying to wake him up,, but she heard the sound of K'<br />
                    <br />
                    When she looked back HCM-280 had held them in whips of grass yet too strong to broke<br />
                    <br />
                    Then she understood what ursh wanted to say<br />
                    <br />
                    She quickly went inside the house and brought a black box , quickly switched it on<br />
                    <br />
                    Further HCM-521 released everyone put hands on ears,, screamed at with the scream,, some roots came out of the ground which swirl around him,, capturing him forever<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : finally that's over,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : but how<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : it is an ultrasound box which we humans can't hear,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further they took ursh inside,, after some time and a little treatment by raav he woke up and shouted<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : his weakness is ultrasound,, use the bo..<br />
                    <br />
                    But stopped as he saw that he was inside as everyone was safe<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : oh, you understood<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : yeah,, do you need to rest,, or we can move<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : what, let him rest<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : no,, we need to find K as soon as possible<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Ursh stood up from bed but as moved first step , got down on a knee,, and coughed<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : I am sorry, I asked  that ,, you must rest<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : I am fine,, let's move<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : instead make a plan for further moves , meanwhile he will also take rest,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : seems good<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : if anyone has no problem then can I ask something?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : how ursh knew their weaknesses<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : hmmm, I was thinking how no one asked  that, so actually as you all know I was put in a cage ,, despite you all were totally unconscious,, I wasn't but I acted a little to be unconscious , so that they would not care about me,,<br />
                    <br />
                    And I was in one room , they were in another, discussing something,, I couldn't hear that,, but I saw a file kept on a  nearby table , I tried to take it, despite the fact that I failed many times,, but with time and patience,, I succeeded and so started ready it<br />
                    <br />
                    It were HCMs the human contentment monsters,, despite they are fusion of any 2 different species, as we saw , ,  and as all of them have a little content of human dna, so that they could get human consciousness,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Like as I remember the 2 we fought recently were vultrix and tigris  ,  so as I moved further I saw total 20 of them,, 5 on each page,,means 4 on corners of each page and one in center, who was formed by merging of the 4 ,, as I titled the page,, I further reached strength and weakness of them and so I could read weakness of total 16 of them which were normal fusion ,, but sadly,, at that time, one of them came , snatched it from me,, and then released a toxic gas, to make me unconscious for real<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : damn,, nice,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : but..<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : as I was being unconscious, I saw the last page of the file,, something like ' the greatest fusion ' was written on it, i couldn't see much,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : was there any description or photo?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : no<br />
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    K' : so what's the plan?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : let's move out and discuss,, let ursh rest<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : thanks, at least someone cared<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki smiled<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone moved out<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : I don't think so a plan is really needed as we only have to visit those bases,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : but...<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly ursh came out and said , " I have a plan"<br />
                    <br />
                    Next we could see was<br />
                    A monster<br />
                    With a lion face, metal body and tentacles<br />
                    <br />
                    It was near the house and staring at it<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile inside<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : so, let's execute the plan and move<br />
                    <br />
                    As all of them took the first step<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly the front wall of the house broke and all the security systems were also broken so they quickly moved ahead ,, looking outside they the monster<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : oh no, 1st super merge,, humotardilixian ,, guys we have to execute the plan on him only,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then they all one by one started trying to defeat him, either by ultrasound or water or electric shock or a flame thrower and even with fire extinguisher<br />
                    <br />
                    But nothing worked on him<br />
                    <br />
                    Then humotardilixian did a roar everyone flew in the air as all were in lying position ursh gave signals with hands and with that all of them pretended to be dead ,, on seeing that humotardilixian ,, started going back<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : let's follow him and our plan ,,<br />
                    <br />
                    As they moved outside and now it was a little far, suddenly a police jeep came<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : whattt,, that wasn't in our plan<br />
                    <br />
                    Further 2 policemen got off the jeep<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman 1 : who is ursh here?<br />

                    Ursh : me, why?<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman 2 : you are accused,, so come<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : but ,what have I done ?<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman 1 : there is a murder charge on you<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : what,, but I..<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : guys, I am going to follow him or else<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : yeah,, just share the location when you would be called<br />
                    <br />
                    With that pray said yes and quickly on the bike went in that direction<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman 1 : everything would be discussed in police station so come or else we have to force you<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : can you give me just 2-3 minutes<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman 2 : no,,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman 1 : ah,, fine,, take<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : guys you all go and follow I will come after the interrogation<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : and if they are sent by the enemies,, I will stay here,, K' and raav go<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ursh would be taken to police station and you would be alone here I can't go leaving you alone<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : but...<br />
                    <br />
                    With that suddenly a bike sound came and a person on a super bike arrived in a  stylish manner,, got off,, removed the helmet<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ahh, I have seen you somewhere, oh sam you?<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : yeah buddy<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : oh yes,, once we were in the same class<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : yeah,, hello everyone,, firstly ursh you must go with police , raav and K go towards that monster and I will stay with paki ,, and yes both of you can take my bike<br />
                    <br />
                    With that everyone went and here paki and sam were left<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : have I seen you,, I totally remember I never talked to you but I a little bit recognize your face<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : for 2 years we were in the same class<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : ohk,, sorry but I don't actually remember<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : no worries<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : but tell me how did you know that we would need someone<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : hmmm, actually K texted me SOS code but I was so busy that I didn't even check that someone after a very long time, texted me,, I checked it later ,, I knew he must have sent sos code to cheg too so I contacted him,, so he told me from what pressure of public and hate is K going through,, but said me not to come as they are enough , so I also took that leniently,, but recently I got a video msg of cheg which again was 3-4 days earlier but I saw it yesterday night where he firstly told that if I am seeing it then he must me dead,, and then further all the story from that hate to the point where K ended their training,, so I woke up early and with highest speed came,, as I was coming I heard a blast when I switched on the binoculars present in helmet, I saw that monster,, and further came and saw police so it was obvious what was happening,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : ohk,, thanks for coming but I guess one thing you must know is the person here was not K,, he was K' ,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : what,, literally but how,, I mean what happened after the training session?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : let's first find out how we could save ursh<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam(smiling and a very sweet way) : as you say<br />
                    <br />
                    Next coming to the police station scene<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : so who has accused me?<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman 1 : see ,, she is sitting there at the bench<br />
                    <br />
                    When ursh looked there<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : what,, youu, sir she is lying,, just wanna take revenge and tell me whom have I murdered,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Girl : you have murdered my husband to take revenge from me<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : noo,, what proof do you have ?<br />
                    <br />
                    Then the policeman showed him a video in a phone where he and one more guy were on a mountain, and he stabbed him on the back and pushed him down the cliff<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : whatt,, this is a fake video,, I don't even know this man,, I am telling,, suti is lying<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman : that means, you know here,, and you have a reason,, and a proof is there so why should I trust you<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : did you record this video?<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman : no, I get this from her<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : for my sake just ask from AI whether this video is real or AI generated<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman : whatever the answer would be,, we don't trust AI<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ok ok,, I have an argument<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman: what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : if she recorded this video, why did she not interrupt and let her husband die<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : I didn't record it ,, one of my friends in the media did so,, she got scared, seeing a knife in your hand so hid behind a bush and recorded and yes at that time I was in the hotel room<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman 1 : so,, all proofs are against you , so you would be presented in the court, and I will make sure a life imprisonment along with that you have to pay a large amount to her<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman then whispered in his ears<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman: but you can save yourself,, just handle K to us, we will put your punishment on him and you would be totally safe<br />
                    <br />
                    Then ursh said aloud<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : oh,, your idea is brilliant,, but you know what I totally reject,, you asked the wrong person,, so sad<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : what ! ,, what idea<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman : nothing, nothing, let me tell your proposal<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : ok<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : what? What proposal?<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman : if you say yes to one condition then your life imprisonment may change to just 1-2 years<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : okay, tell , what's it<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman : one, give half of your total assets, and 2nd kneel down in front of her and say sorry,, by these 2 things your punishment would be reduced<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : nah, never,, and yes I have a very important work, and as I know I am innocent so I am going<br />
                    <br />
                    As ursh stepped towards the door, 20-25 policemen appeared in front of him,, coming from inside cabinets<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh (inside) : oh,, that will take too much time,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ok ok,, I am not going,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Policeman : decide quickly  whether you have to make the deal or fight court case, and till that remain in jail<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ok ok i am ready to make the deal,, but I too have a condition<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : what ?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : for now, please let me go, and I promise I will surely come back to policestation<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : hmmm,, how can I trust you,, wait , one last deal for you<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : what ?<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : if you are ready to become my slave for the rest of your life,, you can go and yes no punishment would be assigned to you and as you would be my slave so your whole property would be mine<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh laughed<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : do you really think K would spare you, that you took benefit of my compulsion ,, i am going,, none can stop me,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then a fight started between policemen and ursh in which policemen had long wooden rods and ursh who was barehanded<br />
                    <br />
                    Due to training ursh could  easily broke their rods<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly suti interrupted and everyone stopped<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : wait,, ok ursh, you can go,, but will you fulfill my one request,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : first I am sorry,, I made false allegations on you,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : tell the request immediately<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti (with very innocent eyes): why so rude , can I come near , I want to tell it in your ears<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ok<br />
                    <br />
                    Then she with her hands folded at back start coming near ursh with innocent eyes and childish walk<br />
                    <br />
                    As she came near his ears<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : my request is<br />
                    <br />
                    With that ursh felt a shock<br />
                    <br />
                    She stunned ursh with the stun gun, in her hands,, and went back<br />
                    <br />
                    Now 4-5 policemen held ursh,, as he was still conscious<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : so, now what, now you are totally in my control,, leave him<br />
                    <br />
                    Then the policemen pushed ursh,, making him fall in front of her<br />
                    <br />
                    But somehow ursh prevented himself from falling down at knees , with help of hands and stood back again<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : oh wow ,, but not for much more time<br />
                    <br />
                    Then she started moving towards Ursh with an evil smile moreover now it was almost night<br />
                    <br />
                    On one hand Ursh was facing this,, on the other side Pray was following humotardilixian efficiently , despite the monster had a good speed and even could jump but he too was hiding himself from humans so his average speed was little slow so pray could easily follow him ,, after moving for a long time, night happened, and now there were very less humans moreover they were in a plateau type region , it was lava on both the sides of a broad pathway and few rocks in between the pathway, where pray would hide in between if felt to,, now pray knew that speed of monster would be unbeatable,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray to himself: I wished not to use it but I guess I have to<br />
                    <br />
                    With that he took out something from his pocket and threw at the monster<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray to himself : I hope he doesn't recognize the tracker<br />
                    <br />
                    Despite he threw the tracker, he was following it  on the bike<br />
                    <br />
                    But sadly the monster flew away from his eyes, but still Pray was following through the location of the tracker in the phone but suddenly he with his bike flew in air as a tree appeared from the ground<br />
                    <br />
                    It was a burning tree, with that 2 more burning trees appeared from the ground , ready to attack, blocking the way, pray moved  a little back but suddenly heard many laughs, when he looked, he saw 4-5 burning stones with a face, laughing ,<br />
                    <br />
                    he was trapped from all directions from these monsters<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas raav and K' were following the location sent by Pray on Sam's bike<br />
                    <br />
                    As they were moving,, it was a type of area where they could see no houses on sides, but only plants and bushes on both the sides of the road they were moving<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly a person totally in white dress, with a prism shaped mask appeared in front of them, so they quickly applied the  brakes ,, and within seconds numerous same type of people appeared from both left and direction<br />
                    <br />
                    Before both of them could think something 20-30 people totally in white were present in front of them<br />
                    <br />
                    Then one of them spoke , " Come with us "<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : but why? And who are you?<br />
                    <br />
                    That person : our leader has ordered us to take any one of you with us,, so decide who will come, or else we will take both of you forcefully<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : give us a minute<br />
                    <br />
                    Then K' said raav to go further<br />
                    <br />
                    But raav disagreed and said K' to go<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : if K was here and told you to go,, would you then go or not<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : maybe no, because I would never leave K alone<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : please understand these are 20-30 and at least one of us needs to reach Pray as soon as possible<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : hmmm, alright,, I will go but remember to call me,, whenever you escape them, take my number<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : ah, I don't have a phone,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : take this one and yes it has my number already saved, so call me,, and if you didn't call within 30 minutes,, I will come back,, and if you need help just msg me anything,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : ok ok, now go,, or else they would take both of us<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ok<br />
                    <br />
                    With that K' went with those people and raav went further on the bike<br />
                    <br />
                    As K' was following, they finally stopped after 5-10 minutes and he saw 10-20 more people in the same white dress, enchanting something , worshiping devil ,, and with that those 20-30 too joined them,, carrying K' in middle,, then one of them who was in same white colour dress but it was different from others came in front and spoke , " This is the night,, are we ready for the sacrifice,, "<br />
                    <br />
                    Then all of them spoke 'yes' collectively,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Now K' knew what they were going to do,, as all of them were looking at him only when he spoke
                    'sacrifice ' ,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas as raav was going on the bike suddenly 4-5 men came in front of him,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav stopped the bike<br />
                    <br />
                    Men 1 : please stop and come with us<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : what! Why! And who are you?<br />
                    <br />
                    Men 2 : it's a request, please come with us, our goddess is calling you<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : what do you mean by goddess<br />
                    <br />
                    Men 1 : she is a messenger of God and for all of us she is our goddess , she wants to protect us from the upcoming disaster, as earlier she protected us in 2012 then in 2020 further in 2030 now in 2040<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ohk, but i have a very important take to do, please let me go<br />
                    <br />
                    Men 2 : we request, please come with us, or else we all will die<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ok fine<br />
                    <br />
                    Then they all took raav to the place where they all lived ,, it was a big area in which there were numerous people,, most of them had wounds on them,, they were doing different tasks like some were cleaning, some were gate keepers, some were farming on nearby field,, seeing all this raav entered the house ,, on moving till main hall,, when he opened the door of main hall he saw a girl with mask sitting on a throne<br />
                    <br />
                    She ordered everyone else to move out and leave raav and her in the room<br />
                    <br />
                    Leader(girl) : welcome raav,, you did wrong to take antagonism from the world leaders,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : hmmm, but why they are following your every command , did you purchased all of them<br />
                    <br />
                    Girl : nah, that's done by foolish ones , I made them realize that I am a messenger of God, if they worship me they would all remain protected from disasters,, and whenever their death will come, after dying they would surely go to heaven, so they never disobey my any command<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : damn, how they don't know outside world as now internet is spread everywhere<br />
                    <br />
                    Girl : cause most of them took birth under my feet and will die under my feet,,  their ancestors worshipped me when there was no internet, they will do and their upcoming generation too<br />
                    <br />
                    With that she laughed<br />
                    <br />
                    And said, " But cause of your disturbance to world fixed rules, you have to die"<br />
                    <br />
                    With that she shouted
                    'guards ' and with that 10-15 men came inside with axe or small knives in their hands<br />
                    <br />
                    Girl : kill him if you all have to live and want heaven,, he is an evil person disobeying the rules of God, so kill him<br />
                    <br />
                    With that everyone with their weapons rushed towards him and put the weapons on neck of raav covering him from all sides ..<br />
                    <br />
                    With that part 2 ends where ursh , almost unconscious, standing in the police station, pray trapped between those monsters, K' trapped between those atheists and raav between these cultists and it's a night with black clouds and strong thunder for all of them .<br />
                    <br />
                    How would everyone escape ,, let's see in part 3 <br /><br /><br />

                </p>

                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>PART-3 (a) </h2>

                <p>
                    <br />
                    So at last we saw Raav, K' , Pray and Ursh were trapped in different situations so, let's continue<br />
                    <br />
                    So all the cultists were going to attack raav and kept, the weapons were around his neck,, but before the weapons could harm him , raav shouted, "Stop"<br />
                    <br />
                    Then the girl lifted her hand giving a sign to everyone to stop<br />
                    <br />
                    Girl : what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : please give me some minutes, I want to discuss something with you<br />
                    <br />
                    Girl : everyone come back to position<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : can you send them outside for some minutes<br />
                    <br />
                    Girl : ok, but after that dont try to move from your position, or else<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ok sure<br />
                    <br />
                    Then she ordered guards to go outside , after that<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : can you first tell your name, so that it's easy to talk<br />
                    <br />
                    Then she laughed<br />
                    <br />
                    Girl : ah, i guess it's your last wish, which I must fulfill,, my name is anya<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ok, so i wanted to say that, please let me go, why you want to kill me, i have no enmity with you ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : but you do have a problem with our leader, so..<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : and what if I flew away from here<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : you can try, on all sides , my slaves are present,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : oh, your slaves,, what if I tell them the truth about you<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : oh,, I got scared , you can try,, if you think you will succeed, but let me show you something, please move at right or left of the door<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Raav moved as she said so, then she moved outside and then clapped<br />
                    <br />
                    Further raav saw 5-6 men come inside the room, lying horizontally on the path to the throne, with their chest above,, further Anya came inside, stepping on each of them, going to the throne, and then sat on the throne, which one of the men was just below her feet, rest all went away,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : so, now you understand, what I am to these people<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav was expressionless<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : can I ask you a question?<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : oh, what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : you said they took birth and die under your feet , so how birth as I can't see any women here?<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : nice observation, as you are going to die in a few minutes so let me tell you, actually all the females are in other domes ,  behind my mansion,, and as soon as they give 2 children, I order them to leave this place<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : that means you are ruining lives of numerous males and females<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : of course, but not properly of females as they can live their lives as they want afterwards<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Raav started laughing<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : now I understand, how cowardly you are<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya(anger) : what do you mean, with my single order they could just kill you in seconds<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : that's what, you are totally dependent on them and they are on each other, if you believe you aren't, then give me a chance<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : what chance?<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : give me a challenge and if I won, I would be allowed to go or else<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya: or else I would kiss you<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : one request, instead of killing,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : I will join them,, i.e I would too be your slave<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : ok,, take one day, tomorrow night your challenge would be started till now rest in the living room upstairs<br />
                    <br />
                    As raav reached there, locked the room<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav ( inside) ( in sorrow) : sorry K, I had to do that for survival, now even if I lost , but i promise, I wouldn't accept her slavery at any cost<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas Anya was talking to someone on mobile<br />
                    <br />
                    Other person: what, why don't you kill him as ordered<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : it was about my respect, but don't worry, he would not be able to complete my challenge, and would be my slave for his whole life<br />
                    <br />
                    Other person : just listen, kill him, or else you would definitely be in trouble<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : Ok<br />
                    <br />
                    Other person : listen, just decrease his will power and confidence , the challenge would be the next day after tomorrow morning,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : Ok<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile as K' was trapped between those atheists, he was in center and one of them came to tie him but K' dodged<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : you can't even touch me,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then one by one everyone rushed towards him to hit him and make him unconscious but every time K' dodged<br />
                    <br />
                    They threw weapons at him but still K' dodged<br />
                    <br />
                    As such Dodging them he went out of the circle i.e escaped them  , but as he was moving he came under a tree and within seconds a cage dropped which trapped him, then they pushed the cage,, K' had to move along the cage, and made it come in center<br />
                    <br />
                    Leader : satan is with us, I just rechecked and realized that the night we were waiting for is after 48 hours i.e night after tomorrow's night, so till then let him be in the cage,<br />
                    <br />
                    While Pray tried fighting those monsters,, as the stones attacked him with fireball, he dodged whereas when the stones themselves lifted in air and attacked him,, he caught them, despite as they were burning so pray's hand was too burned , he managed to throw them,, meanwhile the trees released flame thrower which burned his t-shirt, so he had to quickly remove it and then somehow by rubbing it on ground, stopped the fire, but now those stones were increasing in number , not near to him, but he could see them coming,, so he went backwards towards the big stone,, behind which he hid himself and thought that maybe they would be less powerful in day time and, his hand would also heal a little bit,, so he sat down, back towards the rock and closes eyes to relax for a while and think plans for further,<br />
                    <br />
                    While Suti was moving towards Ursh, while moving<br />
                    <br />
                    Suti : i would not spare you , all my revenge would be taken, I never expected ,<br />
                    <br />
                    As she reached near him, held and stretched his hair  but anything she could do further, she heard a noise of breaking of wall<br />
                    <br />
                    The side walls of the police station were broken,, and from that sphinix entered,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix : Leave Ursh ,  or else I will kill you all<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Ursh came in front of Suti<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh(low voice) : leave from here,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Suti ran away from the police station<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh ( low voice) : Don't you try to harm any of them or else<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix : don't consider me as your enemy, I am your friend ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly paki appeared from behind<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : he is our friend , we came to save you<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : oh, ok, means now I can become unconscious<br />
                    <br />
                    Then ursh became unconscious but sphinix held him and took away from the police station along with Paki and Sam<br />
                    <br />
                    After some time they stopped in between the  path of location sent by Pray,, as Ursh was unconscious, so they decided to stop, let him and themselves rest under a tree until morning,,<br />
                    Where all sphinix rested on branches of the tree and these 3 sat under the tree, with back leaned to the trunk,<br />
                    <br />
                    So with that the sun rose<br />
                    <br />
                    As Ursh woke , he shouted, " Kill him with the help of gold<br />
                    <br />
                    Cause of that  sphinix also woke up in shock and fell on the ground, cause of the waves and noise of sphinix falling on the ground, paki and sam woke up<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : bro bro bro,, pls chill, he is in our team,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ah,, i forgot ,,  sorry sphinix brother<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix : alright , so shall we move,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : wait for a few minutes,, let everyone come out of sleepy nature<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : ok ok, I got awake, we can move<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : but first tell me, what happened, after I got unconscious and how is he in our team and here?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : nothing much, we carried you here, they all were scared,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then she told , how sphinix became friend, during the battle,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : then when you were gone to the police station, me and sam were discussing, what to do, even though we didn't know the case , so we also came to the police station, but as we reached there, one of the policemen stopped us outside, not letting us go inside , then we both tried to trick him,  sam started talking to him,  making him confuse in the talk, and I tried to flew inside but as I stepped, many more policemen came and pushed me, despite we could defeat them, but that was our last option, then I moved around the police station, saw a window, then tried entering it but suddenly heard ' excuse me' of a policeman, when I looked back, he had a gun, pointee to sam, so I had to  come down, further he put both of us in van, and a little away threw both of us in the yard, and warned us not to come again ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : are you ok,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : yes yes, don't worry, so further, we sat there, and no idea was striking our mind , sam was sorry as because of him I couldn't enter but I made him relax, that it isn't his fault , so now I decided to fight them properly alone,,<br />
                    Despite that sam disagreed that he would help me in the fight but I explained to him that he is not trained , and instead he could give a back cover, by hiding behind,,<br />
                    <br />
                    So we reached the police station once again , hidden behind a tree , so further I came in front of the policemen standing there, as now they were frustrated, one of them whistled, with that 4-5 lady police officers came, both of us rushed towards each other, as we were going to meet, Sphinix entered in between, carried me away,  I scolded him for the act but suddenly I saw I was behind one of another walls, so I understood his plan , next he broke that wall and so all that happened<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : thanks sphinix<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix : anything for my sister, but shall we move now?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : yes but first tell me how you know that I was in trouble?<br />
                    <br />
                    Coming to Pray scene<br />
                    <br />
                    As it was day time so he thought it would be easier than the night<br />
                    <br />
                    So he again moved further<br />
                    But he was wrong, they were the same in number as earlier,<br />
                    <br />
                    So he somehow ran back to the stone, after thinking for some minutes he got a plan but for that first he needed to heal his burned hands<br />
                    <br />
                    So he decided to move back<br />
                    <br />
                    As he moved back, he saw 2 ways, one from where he came and one more, which he ignored while following the monster<br />
                    <br />
                    They were not perfectly right and left but almost nearer to each other, so he was confused<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray (to himself) : no need to remember that I must quickly go to any of them, I just need water or medicine<br />
                    <br />
                    So he chose the left path<br />
                    <br />
                    As he went further he entered a village, he decided to ask someone for medicine or any type of bandage or strip Tu put at his hands<br />
                    <br />
                    So he knocked on one of the doors , and a few seconds later an old man opened the door<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile<br />
                    K' was still sleeping,<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas raav,<br />
                    <br />
                    Who woke up in the morning, came out of the room, a person standing there gave him a message that their goddess is calling him in the hall<br />
                    <br />
                    He went there<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya ( confident tone) : I decided to give you some time to prepare so your challenge would be tomorrow morning instead of today's night<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav (a little confused ): Ok, if you say so<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : come with me I wanna show you something<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav further followed her<br />
                    <br />
                    She took him to an arena area<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : so here my fighters are trained,, and you know what all of them fight with another, when one wins, he is gone to prevention zone, i.e he is safe, and one who lost have to fight next one, and it is done till all of them take one fight,<br />
                    <br />
                    And yes the last match has no rules, I mean the only rule was not to kill the person, which is not followed in the last match, and so one, i.e.the weakest one dies , do you remember I said, " They die under my feet ." Let me show you, as today is the last match going to start in a few minutes<br />
                    <br />
                    So 2 men came, started fighting with their hands, legs , heads, using sand in the arena, further both of them took heavy wooden rods from their helpers and started fighting with them, but one who seemed to lose because of his weaker body, attacked other at legs, which made other one fall, so he started beating him continuously with the stick  on head ,  after some time that guy exclaimed, " Please let me go, I am on verge to death, please let me die there only "<br />
                    So the person beating him stopped , held him from his neck and threw him at the feet of Anya, then the person held her feet and put it on his neck, and said, " Please kill me, I want salvation, please "<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Anya said, " Sure " And with that increased the pressure of her feet on him and within a few minutes he died<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : If you want, you can go to your room and prepare<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav was stunned and was slowly moving back<br />
                    <br />
                    As he was still in the ground, he saw the person who was under her feet all the time Anya was sitting on the throne<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : hello brother,<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy : hello,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : can I ask you something only if this talk remains within us, don't tell anything to your mistress<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy : yes, ask<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : are all of you dumb, Or what, she is fooling you and you are becoming a fool, why the hell you all are considering her as goddess, believe me she is just a manipulator<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy : you know what, you are lucky as you said all this only to me, if you said this in front of anyone else he must have told Anya about that or started beating you with others<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : are you not one of them as i thought you to be one of the most foolish of them<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy : no brother, I am like you, I was normal guy who  wanted to expose this cult but got trapped here, I asked her for a chance which she gave in the form of a challenge which I won , but they traced the location of my family, and she is person warned me if I didn't agree her then she would kill them,  I couldn't even sucide, and further she gave me that job,, as she was getting a high level of satisfaction,, whereas told everyone here that I am also a worshiper of her<br />
                    <br />
                    With that the guy startes crying,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : don't cry bro, I will try to win,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav ( inside) : flew from here and save you all<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy : I really hope you win and they let you go as I am sure she would replace you with me and I have to.. Sorry I can't tell more or else they wouldn't spare me, sorry<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : no worries, take care, can you tell what happens if a person loose the challenge<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy : I don't know but ( pointing to someone) he is the one who lost, ask him, I rarely see him outside<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav was totally shocked, despite moving towards that guy<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas coming to paki and ursh scene<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix : I will tell you, but you forgot to ask ursh, what happened in police station<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh yeah, so ursh, why did they capture you?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : It was Suti<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : what! Not again, I am sure she would be doing the same thing again<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : yeah, but in a different way, moreover now she wanted me to become her slave,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : wait, wait, wait, who is Suti<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : just leave it, a bad memory, let's move further,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : yeah, btw this time again she was using her fake innocent face,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : And you again fall<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : I just remembered all the moments, so I was totally blank, cause of that she was successful to give that shock<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : what !  Did she! I will not spare her, once all this gets over, she will<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : just leave this topic, I guess we must move<br />
                    <br />
                    Further they started moving on the live location sent by Pray but<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : hey see, the location is so far, he went on bike<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : hmmm, but what we can do, we are just walking, I guess we must run<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : but that will drain our energy easily<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix : I guess I have something,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then he made a sound 3 times and with that ,3 horses came,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix: they are horses of one of the fastest species,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : thanks, we will ride them, but..<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix : what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : actually, I wanted to say that, you must move along hiding spots as such no human sees you, <br /><br />

                    Sphinix: oh right, you move and I will come along through the jungle or Hiding myself in between<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : okay,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then all of them sat on each horse and moved at high speed while sphinix went through the jungle area ,  jumping through the trees<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile Pray who knocked at a door and an old man opened it<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man (wet his lips with tongue and harsh voice): who are you man,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : actually my name is Pray, and if you don't mind do you have any medicine which I could put on my burned  hands ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : oh, yeah yeah, why not come inside son, come inside<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray entered the house, but as he entered a weird smell was coming, but he didn't say anything just moved<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : uncle, do you live alone,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : nah, l live with my family,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : oh, nice, can I ask who are your family members<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : my wife, our son, our daughter in law, their son, their daughter, and,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : ahh, sorry for Interrupting  you but I am really in pain, could you please bring medicine<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : ok ok, but I don't know where it is kept , let me call someone,, yas, come here , see someone, has come,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that in a few seconds a young man, pure white skin,looking like he is in his 16s came from upstairs<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : oh, is he your grandson,<br />
                    <br />
                    Yas : yes dad, oh who are you<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : what he is your.. I mean, I am pray buddy, i just want medicines to heal my burnt hands<br />
                    <br />
                    Yas : ohk, let me find it, till that you can wait on the sofa in our Hall<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : no no, I am ok here,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : please come, we love our guests and for us our guests are our everything<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : ohk, if you insist<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Yas went upstairs, and pray moved further towards the Hall, but he saw 1-2 water droplets on the floor where Yas was standing,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray ( inside) : why am I feeling a very negative vibe as I am in danger, they all are so sweet, but, only sometimes sweetness is real , am I going in a trap, now I can't even move back, or should I<br />
                    <br />
                    Thinking all this he went in Hall and sat on the sofa<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Yas came<br />
                    <br />
                    Yas : sorry brother but we don't have it,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : no worries, I will go, and ask it from someone else,<br />
                    <br />
                    Yas : hey, we said, for us our guests are our everything, we will not let you go before the meal,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : I appreciate your goodness but I am not in a state of eating anything,<br />
                    <br />
                    Yas : but we are, I mean the meal is ready , please come to the dining table once, if you don't like the meal, you may go, moreover you will meet my whole family,<br />
                    <br />
                    When pray reached near the dining table in another room, he saw so many people<br />
                    <br />
                    The old man, his wife beside him, beside the old woman, an empty chair then a girl, further again a boy and a girl, and beside the old man, another girl further a boy and then again a boy and a girl,<br />
                    <br />
                    But the most shocking part was they all were looking young, as of the same age ,and totally white skin,despite their faces being different but all were looking of the same age<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : damn uncle, these are all your children, it's cool, I will not judge, but you have so much energy, wow but where is should I sit and where is the meal?<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : firstly the empty chair is for my son, beside that is my daughter in law, and further their kids,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old woman : and beside my husband is our daughter then her husband and further their kids,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : and yes your seat is on the table and you yourself is the meal<br />
                    <br />
                    Then pray heard a sound of a door slang , Yas had locked the doors ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : that means you all are Canibals<br />
                    <br />
                    Scene shift to raav who was moving to another guy<br />
                    <br />
                    So as he reached him<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : hello brother, sorry but I got to know, you lost a challenge from Anya, and no one knows what punishment you got,<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy 2 : slowly, and please none calls her by her name, everyone here calls her goddess, if anyone would listen then, ok ok i came to know about you, you also challenged her, and now I am the unluckiest guy among all<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : yes,<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy 2 : actually I too did it , and lost, now she just keeps me in an empty room for many days,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : and you don't even get water and food<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy 2 : I get it everyday<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : so what's the deal in that<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy : remember it's a very low height room, with nothing inside, I always have to remain on floor<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : sorry but I couldn't understand how you are unluckiest of all<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy 2 : There is a pipeline from which human waste comes,, I later came to know that the pipeline is connected to her toilet , can you believe where the hell I live, and one more thing, many times some guards call me outside the room , put a blindfold on me and order me to sit in center where they have a red Cross, and not to move, and after that I just feel liquid falling on my face and head, I guess you know what it may be,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav moved a little backwards<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ewww, sorry, I didn't meant it but<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy 2 : no need to explain, it was expected<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : no, no, but I can't smell bad from you<br />
                    <br />
                    Guy 2 : once a week, she allows me to move outside and take a proper bath, and also perfume, but sadly the essence still remains<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav then hugged him and said sorry for his behavior,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then with a disgusting, confused face went towards the house,<br />
                    <br />
                    Now he went to the room and sat down, and thought, " I will let them free but what if I, no no no "<br />
                    <br />
                    Next we could see both the guys, in front of Anya , kneel down, and said, " Your orders are accomplished goddess "<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : nice work, I bless you, you may go to heaven, now go<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya (inside) : now he would be tensed and even can't sleep, and so loose,<br />
                    <br />
                    With this part 3 (a) ends , let's see what will happen in the next part <br /><br />
                </p>
                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>PART-3 (b)</h2>

                <p>
                    <br />

                    At last we saw, paki team coming on horses, Raav, trapped inside his own mind, deep confusion and pray between those Canibals, let's see what will happen next<br />
                    <br />
                    Next coming to pray scene<br />
                    <br />
                    As he found out they all were Canibals<br />
                    <br />
                    He tried to run but all of them circled him ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : please let me go, I am having a really important work to do, I promise never to come here again but please<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : nah nah nah, if we let everyone go like this how would we survive,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : Ok, I am ready to become your meal, but can I have one last wish<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : don't try to trick and go<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : you are 10 , and I am just one, how can I, just grant me one wish,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : ok tell,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : you insisted me to eat, so can you please give me the last meal of my life<br />
                    <br />
                    Old woman: oh, why not, if you eat, you become more healthy and more delicious<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : can I move to dining table<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man : yeah,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray then moved towards the dining table, but while crossing, he snatched the knife present in hands of the smallest girl of the family, and put it at her neck<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : let me go, or else I would<br />
                    <br />
                    Yas : don't do that, we will not spare you<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray moved backwards while warning them,and asking them to let go<br />
                    <br />
                    Old man in a calm tone : ok, you can go, just spare her life<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : ok, then open the doors,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then they opened the door , but pray while putting the knife on her move towards the door, further to the main door, and then pushed her and moved out slamming the door,,<br />
                    <br />
                    But as he moved out he and moved a little suddenly many people came in front of him , some old and the rest looking of the same age,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray to himself: I guess all of them are Canibals ,<br />
                    <br />
                    One of them threw a stick at his hand, making the knife fall and another one at legs, making him fall,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further they tied him with rope and a stick<br />
                    <br />
                    So now on one hand raav was sitting, fighting with himself inside the mind, totally confused, and feared,<br />
                    Whereas paki, ursh, sam were moving quickly on the horses,<br />
                    Pray tied to ropes, and ready to get fried between those Canibals<br />
                    But K' was totally relaxed inside the cage, and during all this almost night came<br />
                    <br />
                    Coming to raav scene<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav remembered something, once K told him that whenever he had a headache he either does meditation or plays guitar i.e his lovable task,<br />
                    <br />
                    So he also decided to meditate<br />
                    <br />
                    After meditating for some time, he could analyze everything that may be he is being tricked<br />
                    <br />
                    As once K told him a story of tenali rama, where once a strong man came to his city, defeated many wrestlers  , so the wrestlers came to him for help, so tenali rama created a fake hype that he is too strong by various means, which made that man worried cause of that he did extra workout, and so at time of battle with tenali rama, got unconscious without even starting the battle, making tenali rama won,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav (inside) : I guess they don't want me to sleep, so I guess let their wish be true,<br />
                    <br />
                    So he decided to meditate as much as possible<br />
                    <br />
                    While pray was requesting them to leave him<br />
                    <br />
                    While he was tied , a very old blind woman came, she was looking as if the age of the mother of the old man, she came near pray, touched her cheeks,<br />
                    <br />
                    Woman : he is very delicious, cook him now, and the meat would be spread according to our rules,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray shouted : please let me go, I just came as I was hurt,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old woman (touching his hands) : what! What is he saying ! Did you all forget our rules ,  we never eat someone who is already hurt,<br />
                    <br />
                    One of them said that they didn't know that , and that family, cause of our rules didn't come out,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old woman: let him go<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : thank you, thank god ,<br />
                    <br />
                    As pray was going suddenly a man appeared, this was the first time a normal man of normal skin tone and age appeared, and everyone else except that old woman kneeled down<br />
                    <br />
                    While looking at a photo<br />
                    <br />
                    Man : wait , he can't go,<br />
                    <br />
                    Old woman : but he has served burns, as I could feel, when I touched his hands<br />
                    <br />
                    Man : I know, but I have medicine , which could heal that within a few minutes<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone started whispering, " What " , " How he could use that "<br />
                    <br />
                    Man : stop! Catch him first<br />
                    <br />
                    With that 2-3 men held pray<br />
                    <br />
                    Then he put out a box from his pocket, opened it and put a green herbal powder at hands of pray<br />
                    <br />
                    After some minutes, his hands were washed and with that his most burns were gone, the remaining ones were not properly visible,<br />
                    <br />
                    As pray saw his hands he smiled,<br />
                    And attacked those men with elbows and then held their neck with his hands, pushed them, punched the 3 men, and quickly ran away from the village<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone was chasing him, but as he entered that lava valley region, everyone stopped and let him go ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : I must wait for morning, for my plan to work for sure,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that he again rested at same place as the last night,<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile raav who was  meditating, slept,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki team also stopped for resting in the night,<br />
                    <br />
                    Morning came<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav woke up and moved in the Hall<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : are you ready for the challenge,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : yes<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : you have to clear 3 challenges, 1st - Parkour<br />
                    2nd - mind<br />
                    3rd - strength<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ohk<br />
                    <br />
                    With that she took him outside, behind this mansion<br />
                    <br />
                    As raav reached, he saw, many broad sticks, in a standing position, fixed to ground,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : reach the other side<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav then started from the smallest one, then as the length of sticks increased, he jumped, now he reached the middle of the path, but at this moment the stick which he had to jump next was far, and more long but still he jumped, but alas missed the jump from a very small distance<br />
                    <br />
                    But happily he held the top with hands, and due to his training, sat on the top, further stood up and jumped to the next ones, and finally reached the final location, despite when he jumped to ground from such height he couldn't balance and fell rolling but, not much damage was taken as he stood up immediately with a smiling face,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : don't worry, you have the 2nd challenge, which you would never be able to pass, despite rest for a while and after rest come in the Hall for the riddles<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile Pray, went towards the tree monster, all 3 appeared,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that stones also came,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray again held them, but this time he threw them inside the mouth of trees while they were excreting fire,<br />
                    <br />
                    Due to that they stopped, started coughing , next he filled sand in his hands and threw  it again in their mouth while they were coughing, cause of that they went again inside the ground, and before that they could return and more stones came, pray quickly went further, out of this valley,<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas raav after some time went to the Hall<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : so, you came, you have to answer 2 out of 3 questions to pass this level,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : okay<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : so the first question is what is the thing which is greater than any other thing, even the god worships and maybe you can live without but could never survive without<br />
                    <br />
                    After thinking a minute<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : love<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : umm, your answer is<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : wait wait wait, let me complete my sentence<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : what?<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : I wanted to say love could be a possible answer but we can survive without it but can't live, but as you asked vice versa so the actual answer is Knowledge<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : hmmm, so you earlier told love, which was,, wrong, and sadly your answer is correct, so the next question is which is the worst drug<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav thought for some time but<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : there are too many drugs, even there are 2 which when mixed can kill anyone within some minutes, but I don't think so you want a medical answer and I can't take names of them ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : I guess we must move to the last question which is ,What are you?<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : what! Let me think<br />
                    <br />
                    After a minute he shouted 'power'<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : oh wow, you are wrong, so now onwards, you are my slave,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : wait wait wait, I was telling answer of previous question, I just got hit so pronounced,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : you have to tell answer of this question, what are you, and your answer to previous question would not be valid now<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav then  recalled a memory of K where he asked the same question but he didn't know at that time , but K told him that<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : So, firstly, I am a boy, then a hindi, further an indian, then a human being but despite of that all I am a creature<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : how! Well done, you are promoted to the last stage i.e.strength, (in sad tone) go , rest for now<br />
                    <br />
                    After some time raav was called, a guard took him to the arena where Anya was already present<br />
                    <br />
                    It was evening now<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : so, this is our best fighter, fight and win freedom<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : okay<br />
                    <br />
                    Then both of them entered the arena , and then a bell rang and the fight started<br />
                    <br />
                    Fighter jumped in air, and attacked raav with a punch, but raav held the wrist, stopping him in the middle, but suddenly thr fighter in middle of air attacked stomach of raav with his feet, making raav fell down,<br />
                    <br />
                    With one hand on stomach, raav exclaimed "Ahh" in pain<br />
                    <br />
                    But somehow stood up, but now the fighter ,doing acrobatics, i.e firstly on legs then on hands and so on for 3-4 times tried hitting raav, but raav dodged it<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav(inside): I guess I need to defeat him with his own technique<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav too did the same aerobatics to hit him, but he easily dodged it, despite raav suddenly put sand, which he picked up while aerobatics , inside his eyes, so for a moment he started rubbing his eyes, so taking benefit raav held his neck with his arms,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : accept defeat<br />
                    <br />
                    Fighter : no<br />
                    <br />
                    On saying that fighter rolled raav 360 degree about his shoulder and strike raav at the ground and with that he jumped over him and attacked his chest with his elbow<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav shouted, " Ahhhh"<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone started cheering his name, everyone thought he won<br />
                    <br />
                    But suddenly raav stood up<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : fight is not over yet<br />
                    <br />
                    The fighter used the same jump as earlier but this time Raav held his wrist, started swirling him and then threw him at the ground, further attacked his back with his knee, held his neck and started pushing it,<br />
                    <br />
                    Fighter ( tapping on ground with one hand): ok ok I lost,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav stood up, gave a hand for him to stand<br />
                    <br />
                    But Anya shouted,              " Everyone attack "<br />
                    <br />
                    With that each of the fighters seeing the match rushed towards raav<br />
                    <br />
                    Coming to K' scene<br />
                    <br />
                    Leader : so the time has come, soon we will give his sacrifice,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' (to himself) : they think they can (laughed )<br />
                    <br />
                    After a few hours, night happened<br />
                    <br />
                    They opened his cage, without touching him, tied long ropes,<br />
                    <br />
                    4 ropes tied to his hands and legs were pulling him, they made his neck place over a wooden block, and they were ready, to rip off his neck using a sharp axe<br />
                    <br />
                    As the leader held the axe and was about to use it, as the axe was in air moving towards his neck<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : 1 , 2 and 3<br />
                    <br />
                    With that 3<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh, paki and sam jumped in between, making the axe fall down from the hands of the leader ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix also entered the area, roaring, cause of that everyone else got scared and stopped meanwhile everyone left the area and then sphinix too<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : thanks,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : our pleasure but where is raav<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : I told him to move further but he is in danger,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : how do you know that<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : he promised me that if I didn't call him that I am safe then he would come back but he didn't so ....<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : I guess we need to move quickly,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' sat with ursh on the horse and then they rushed, saw the bike so stopped<br />
                    <br />
                    They started searching here and there<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh: come here, I guess he is raav, he is running, and many people are running behind<br />
                    <br />
                    They all reached raav and as all the cultists saw 5 men so stopped,<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya was also coming but as she saw paki she ordered everyone to come back before any of paki team could see her<br />
                    <br />
                    So they all rushed to the main road, and asked raav and K' what happened<br />
                    <br />
                    K' told everything to them as nothing much happened,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further raav told them everything till the last fight<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : ohk, so how you escaped everyone<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : as they were about to attack, a blast sound came near from her mansion, which diverted their mind and meanwhile i escaped, as I was searching the path, that 2nd guy whom I hugged, approached me and told that the blast was done by him, and also told the path, he did so cause he felt a brotherhood from me cause of that hug and also a sign that I could be right and may save all of them, so I escaped but one of them saw me and hence everyone came after<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : nice, in K would be here he would be really proud of you,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : thanks ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : I guess we must move towards the location, pray is alone, from a long time<br />
                    <br />
                    Then everyone started moving, even it was night, still they didn't took rest<br />
                    <br />
                    But pray took rest for the night<br />
                    <br />
                    Aa such morning happened<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray again started moving, after some time he reached an ocean, as he could only see water in front of him, he got off the bike and as he took first step inside the ocean<br />
                    <br />
                    A great roar came, which made him step back<br />
                    <br />
                    It was a very big gorilla with sand spots on him,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray was shocked,<br />
                    <br />
                    As it attacked him with a punch, suddenly sphinix came and stopped that punch, pray then moved aside and sphinix also, pushing the monster a little , moved back, now all of them were together, then that monster growled with that humodardilixian appeared , and a tiger with wings and fire on body and ice on hands also came, and also a wolf faced, metal body, wings,and red eyes appeared<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : these are the 4 super merged monsters<br />
                    <br />
                    That gorilla went near sphinix to fight<br />
                    <br />
                    While the flying wolf was attacking with lazer beam at paki amd sam<br />
                    <br />
                    And the flying tiger, attacking prag and raav and K'<br />
                    <br />
                    Humodardilixian came forward to  attack ursh with his tentacles<br />
                    <br />
                    Despite ursh was trying to dodge but he fell down, and the tentacle was coming towards him with great speed , as the tentacles were near his chest, everyone saw humodardilixian thrown behind with the tentacles.<br />
                    <br />
                    It was K who came in between<br />
                    <br />
                    K : If Ursh is in trouble, how can K not come?<br />
                    <br />
                    Btw<br />
                    <br />
                    I AM BACK<br />
                    <br />
                    With this part 3 overs, but how K did that, and where was he,, let's see in the next part, <br /><br />
                </p>
                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>PART-4</h2>

                <p>
                    <br />
                    So at last we saw K was back and saved Ursh<br />
                    <br />
                    K gave a hand to Ursh to help in stand<br />
                    <br />
                    K quickly went near paki and sam, who were dodging from the laser of flying wolf faced monster<br />
                    <br />
                    K : hey , if you dare then fight me, paki help raav and pray I will handle him<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki and sam moved towards them meanwhile  the monster came down to attack whereas K closed his for a moment and raised his right hand in air and within seconds a  rod came with a great speed in K's hand<br />
                    <br />
                    While the monster again attacked with the laser eyes but before the laser could reach K, he, holding the stick from mid, pressed a button on it, with that 1 curver but sharp blade on each side of the rod appeared and K started swirling the rod in such a manner that the laser only touched the blades,, and that swirling was so fast that the laser went back to it's eyes, so the monster<br />
                    <br />
                    Then K quickly threw the blade towards it with high speed but as it reached the monster, it flew and dodged the attack and then  the weapon came back to K<br />
                    <br />
                    Then it did a growl , and then the tiger who was attacking with fire gas, gorilla who was fighting arm to arm with sphinix and humotardilixian who was far away came together, near to each other, ready to attack together,<br />
                    <br />
                    While all were coming together<br />
                    <br />
                    K : guys, at present we can't handle them together, we need to leave,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : but how, our speed is slower than them,<br />
                    <br />
                    K whistled<br />
                    <br />
                    And with that a flying car with open roof appeared with one of them someone driving it<br />
                    <br />
                    K : sphinix hide and go away, you all sit here<br />
                    <br />
                    K then sat beside the driver seat of the car  , paki , ursh , raav on behind seats,, K' , pray and sam behind ursh, paki<br />
                    <br />
                    So before any of the monster could attack them they flew, while sphinix also went backwards towards the forest area,<br />
                    <br />
                    While they were in car<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh: how are you bro, where were you,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I will tell you everything but first reach home,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh (sad face) : oh, our home is a little destroyed<br />
                    <br />
                    K (consoling tone)  : I know, but, I have a bungalow at a secret location, it's like my dream home , it was in progress for a long time and has recently completed, we are heading there,<br />
                    <br />
                    After 1-2 hours they reached a location,<br />
                    <br />
                    A big blue and white bungalow with 2 floors and a roof ,  a stone path way, 2 small swimming pools, one near the house and the other on the left of the stone pathway, rest all the grass, left of the bungalow a large field of wheat in which there was a big windmill and behind the house,a mountain slope,, despite all this area was covered with fence,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : so this is the area, I have been preparing from a very long time,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then K took out his phone and did something,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : only for this time we can enter easily, after that it would be really tough, be prepared,<br />
                    <br />
                    All of them then entered the house through the pathway, after opening the fence gate<br />
                    <br />
                    K told everyone to remove the shoes and only enter after washing their hands and feet<br />
                    <br />
                    After everyone did so and entered the Hall<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray (pointing to the driver of the car) : btw who is he,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : oh yeah, meet him , he is kana , my new friend and also my mentor<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki, Ursh,Raav and Pray together spoke, " What! Really "<br />
                    <br />
                    K just nodded and smiled<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : but where were..<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh interrupted<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : wait, all questions later, firstly K,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : no need to speak, I know what you want to say and believe me I also want that<br />
                    <br />
                    K opened his arms<br />
                    <br />
                    And then both ursh and K hugged , where Ursh had 1-2 tears in his eyes, on the other hand after a minute K got unconscious, while hugging him and leaned on him,<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone noticed that , ursh pulled him forward and backward,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : what happened,.<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : Don't wake him up,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : What? is he sleeping<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : actually he hasn't slept for the last 6-7 days and yes nights too and cause he got relief and satisfaction in his arms so he slept , I know a little about this house, paki you and K have same room which is that side ( pointing towards a room)<br />
                    And you all have your names written on the door<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : paki , let's take K to your room,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then paki and ursh took K to the room, it was a mixture of space, love and , a dark themed room, perfect for K and Paki,<br />
                    <br />
                    They made K sleep on the bed, and came out<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : I guess you all are tired, and must rest, so rest for some time , then either me or K will tell you everything,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh, raav, pray had separate rooms on the ground floor while sam had on the first floor,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : K', you can come with me,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : hmmm, for sure , thanks<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : hey kana, but what about you,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : don't worry about me, I have to go at my place,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : ok, if you say so, but are you really sure ?<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana (smiled) : yes<br />
                    <br />
                    With that kana left the house, went somewhere in the mountains, just by running and jumping<br />
                    <br />
                    Earlier all were just resting but with time all of them slept  ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Next day in the afternoon K', paki and ursh woke up one after another, and with that sam, raav and then pray also,<br />
                    <br />
                    They all came in the Hall<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : did K wake up?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : nah, let him sleep,<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly kana appeared<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : hey guys , did you sleep well<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki (smiled) : oh! Yeah<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : kana, will you please tell us what happened, how you met K and where were you?<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : relax relax, I am telling you everything, so at last you saw K in that fight and I guess K' must have told you that a flash happened and K disappeared , so it was me, who did that flash, and took K<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : but why ?<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly K appeared and said, " Cause I needed harsh training "<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone except K' went near him and hugged him and said that they really missed him<br />
                    <br />
                    K : me too, but this was also important, oh Sam finally you came,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : ummm actually<br />
                    <br />
                    K : no need for any explanation broo, I am happy you came,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam smiled<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : can any of you tell everything, I am confused, how K got that rod, and made that monster flew, moreover he was already trained and<br />
                    <br />
                    K : wait wait, omg pray, be patient, kanaaa, I know you love trolling others, but can I please tell them everything from the start<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana laughed and said, " Ok ok "<br />
                    <br />
                    K : so do you remember one thing that I said when I was in the parallel world, that during the last fight I got a little hurt at chest for a moment but there was no mark and the pain also disappeared within seconds<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : oh yes, I remember it somewhat<br />
                    <br />
                    K : actually at that time, one particle of antimatter entered my body,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : if anyone else would be there then he may get blasted out, but his endurance is capable to handle that , he is deserving one<br />
                    <br />
                    K : but nothing happened, right? Actually remember the last fight when one of the heads was attacking me and the other switching on the machine , so at that time when he punched at my chest, it was the same tool as used in the parallel world, so this time matter entered my body , and both of them met, but not collided so no blast, but I got some powers, one of them was reflex , now I could reflex anything, just like I did, but as I was new to the power, there was high energy inside me, so I got unconscious,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : and I knew that so I took him to high altitude mountain for the training<br />
                    <br />
                    K : when I woke up, I heard a soothing music of flute, it was being played by kana, it was good but I didn't want to talk to him, actually anyone at that time, cause remember cheg and vay, (stopped for a moment and there was a deep silence ) , so where was I , hmm I tried finding the way by myself, but couldn't so I had to talk to him, I asked him if he knew the path, and also if he knew how I reached the place<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : then I told him that I brought him here on my shoulders and yes he could only go if he does the infinity training,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I was confused about who he was and why he wanted to but didn't know why but I was getting positive vibes from him, I politely asked him what he wanted, and let me go but he told me that he had been sent to train me,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : and so he got fed up so again went to find the way, but in that he slipped , and now he was hanging on a weak branch,if he lifted himself then most probably the branch could brake<br />
                    <br />
                    K : and at that time kana arrived, pointed his flute towards me and said to hold it, I resisted as my weight could pull both of us down, but he assured me, and as I had no other choice so, I took his help and came up, and as I didn't know the way so I got ready for the training, after all , I always crave for skills and knowledge, despite I was thinking that is it right to trust this person, but literally I was getting positive vibes from him but suddenly he pushed me and now I was holding the cliff, before I could lift myself he also came down, hanging on me and for many hours  just hanged, further with my support he climbed and then I did so<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : actually I was checking that if he really deserved and was ready for this training , so the first step was to choose and create a weapon,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : and of course he chose the og ' Danda '<br />
                    <br />
                    K ( blushes): yeah , but I had to create it, which I did with the help of branches of trees fallen down, he had a knife, which I used to give a shape to it , the first one was very bad, still after we slid down that peak using a plank he had, next task he gave was to meditate inside the river flowing nearby, it was a little difficult, but I managed to that cause of my earlier training, this all continued in a loop, I made weapon, meditate at surface of the river bed, learning attacks with that weapon , after the 5th loop I made a perfect one, which was actually a good one, then we moved further, I upgraded my wooden stick to stone, it was earlier difficult to break the stone but after time I did so, further he added one more type of meditation along with a training which was to run till top of the peak, stand at the peak on one leg, for an hour them come back down running<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : and he was too eager to meet all of you, he was doing training at night also , he had not thought of that but due to his training at night he can now see completely at night,<br />
                    <br />
                    K: so next came the fire, my task was to light up the fire at that cold temperature , I thought it to be impossible, but still I tried, using leaves and stones, after some minutes fire lighted up but at the same moment settled down, it happened around 20 times and after that I gave up , but he encouraged me, then I thought, and after thinking a little I got an idea, I used my shirt to create a cover, inside which I light up small amount of fire and before It could burn my shirt I spreaded it to a little more i.e a bunch of sticks and then to larger one, the leaves, but now he said to blow it without water, I tried with my hands, legs but it was burning, suddenly he put water at the fire and said to repeat the task , and so I did but still can't light down the fire, but in the 3rd try I jumped over the fire with shirt, and this time due to lack of air and high pressure fire lighted down,<br />
                    Now I was doing all of them in a repeated task, so we moved further and then suddenly a mountain lion attacked us, him first, and he got unconscious<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana (laughed): actually I wasn't, I was just acting, as he himself defeated the lion, and scared him away, then lifted me on back and moved but he got emotional as he was now remembering you at peak ,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : actually 2-3 days had gone but that day I was feeling negative vibes that something bad was going to happen, then he said that Ursh you are in a trouble<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : what, how he knew that,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : he always rants he is living from a very long time and also he knows everything,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : but it was true that I was in trouble, but wait I have one more question that why your power not worked while he pushed you<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : cause at that time he couldn't use his power that easily<br />
                    <br />
                    K : so, where was I, oh yes, I was worried, I didn't want to believe him but still I requested him that we could go back, but he disallowed, but seeing my condition he whistled and called his new friend , wanna know who was that, it was sphinix,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh that means you sent him to help us,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yeah, I said how can ursh be in trouble if I am present (smiled) moreover I told him not to take my name,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh yeah, he was avoiding that,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : so after that I was a little relaxed, continuing my training,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam interrupted<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : if you were moving further then how were you climbing up and down the peak<br />
                    <br />
                    K : actually there were 3 big peaks to be crossed in total and multiple smaller ones which were actually big but smaller than those 3 ,  after that kana suggested one more upgrade in my weapon that was to add a stone blade at both the edges, in different direction, which I really liked , so made it and attached and then trained with it, Now 1 more day had gone, and due to my good training, oh wait he also added pushups with heavy stones at my back, further he gave me a bow and a special rod, the rod you saw during the fight,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : and now was the main part of training , to attach the weapon to him, now the most part of training included the weapon attacks, I made him feel that the rod is part of his body, he threw it away and then try to bring it back to his hands, while it was still,, I know it sounds stupid that how in such a less time is it possible to do so, so here comes the twist, the 2nd ability he got due to matter-antimatter inside his body, actually revolving around his heart, so now he was able to do that, and not only bring back the sword but if he focused well on any object then he could call anything, it's just the game of focus and distance of the object,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : In real this training is so long as according to this training I need to learn all the weapons, Increase the attack damage too but yesterday morning I was missing all of you at high rate, I mean I was disturbed, I was feeling uneasy, so I requested him that at least once I want to see you and  then he showed me his car in which we travelled, actually I was also feeling sad that I am so far from you, you would be in tension about me, but o decided that if you all will be safe or easily overcome  , then I would not show up myself but I felt the need to come and so is it<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : and yes his resistance power also increased due to the training, yet it lacks as still I can push him,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : oh yeah yeah, of course  , so will you all not tell me what happened here before the yesterday fight<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : yeah but I want to ask that didn't you take rest any time?<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : of course he took,, 50 minutes with me, in intervals and 10 minutes alone, per day,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : ohk, nicey<br />
                    <br />
                    Further all of them one by one started telling<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray started and told everything about those lava valley monsters and those Canibals village,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : nice presence of mind broo,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further raav told his side of story , after telling it<br />
                    <br />
                    K : bro what if you have lost then, would you really accept the condition?<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : I don't know, I mean really I don't know, I had not any plan B<br />
                    <br />
                    K : hmmm, it's fine, at least you are safe, nice playing the game of manipulation, like if you can't convince them, confuse them, (laughs) , btw can you repeat her name<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : she said, her name is Anya<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ummm, alright,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : something unordinary?<br />
                    <br />
                    K : no, maybe I am just overthinking, leave it<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : I will tell you everything later, in the room, also what ursh faced<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ohk, btw K' why aren't you speaking anything, will you not tell, what happened to you <br /><br />

                    K' : ahh! Not much, I was trapped between atheist people who were going to give my sacrifice but as I know everything, I knew they would save me<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ohk, nice btw you can shift to cheg's room, and kana you to vay's room ,, I never expected them to..<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : ok ok, if you don't mind can I go to sleep<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yeah sure<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : K, I shouldn't ask that but, how you could possibly made this mansion with all this large land purchased<br />
                    <br />
                    K and Ursh collectively giggled<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki (confused): Ursh, you knew about it<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh (justifying): don't look at me like this, I only know the financial source,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ummm, let's not talk about it,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : if anyone don't mind and take me wrong can I ask something from kana<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : what, yeah sure<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : actually was that training really necessary, I mean we all know K defewted our enemy with not much difficulties, even he had no powers, so when he got then, why the training was needed, I know weaknesses of monsters, with few more weapons, K could defeat them,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : yeah sure, no doubt on that, but something really big is coming! I don't know what but I can sense!<br />
                    <br />
                    With that everyone went to their respective rooms while kana went to his place outside,<br />
                    <br />
                    While K went somewhere else and after 5 minutes came back and knocked at his room in which Paki was already there, lieng on bed with back straight, legs straightened and hands folded, lights were totally dimmed<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki :  come in!<br />
                    <br />
                    K entered<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki (sarcasm) : oh wow, first time in history, this person knocked door while in was inside , can I ask why<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ummm, I thought you were upset from me<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki (leaned towards him) : just tell me true love can't get upset from one another<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yes of course but only if there is no misunderstanding on basis of any negative emotions<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : I don't know but I am a little upset, am I really so much less important to you, that you told Ursh about that and not me , it's ok you told your only biggest fear to him and not me but I guess this area, your biggest project, not even that, I wish I was equally important<br />
                    <br />
                    K : actually<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki: no need of any explanation, I just wanted to say the thing in my heart so I did<br />
                    <br />
                    Saying that she lied in a position to sleep , face opposite to him<br />
                    <br />
                    K : that's good<br />
                    <br />
                    Saying that K moved near her , hugged her from behind, kissed her cheeks<br />
                    <br />
                    K (cute voice) : now my turn, I want to share, will you not listen, I am not justifying, agree you are right here , but I am not wrong<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki (tilting on his side) : of course, how could K be wrong in terms of any girl<br />
                    <br />
                    K (blushed) : hey listen, actually I have shares of many big companies like 1% ,2% or 5% , and due to various situations and conditions, I could make a deal to get the same percent amount of profit per month, and as Ursh is better in business type things so I had to take his help, and I wanted to surprise you with this house, specially this room, didn't you like it?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : it's my dream room, how couldn't I, it's ok this time, but from next time..<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ask everything you want to<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : first tell why you took more than 5 minutes after we all left<br />
                    <br />
                    K : security of this area, to start that<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : fine, now just one last question, what is your fear, I am really curious<br />
                    <br />
                    K : fine but I will only give hint<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : ok ok I don't have any problem with that<br />
                    <br />
                    K : My real fear is INFINITY<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : ok I will try figuring out,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : now should we relax or umm something something<br />
                    <br />
                    K was now tickling her at her stomach and she was blushing<br />
                    <br />
                    But suddenly someone knocked,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : come inside bro<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : umm, I guess I should have come later<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : if it is something important than please sit<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : maybe yes, as I have some doubts , wanna ask K about them<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : ok should I leave<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : no need, you can also suggest your opinion on them<br />
                    <br />
                    All of the 3 then sat on the bed, switched on the lights<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : first I wanted to ask if kana is really trustworthy?  I mean we all are getting positive vibes from him, but are you sure?<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yes, I have seen, in his eyes, the unconditional love and care towards me, like a true friend,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ohk,, you believe him and I believe you, one more thing, I have to go to the police station<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : but why<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : actually before you saved me, I promised them then once they let me go, I will surely come back, soo<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ohh, can you go tomorrow morning, there would be a surprise for you<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : okk, if you say,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh left, paki told everything happened with her and Ursh and then slept<br />
                    <br />
                    Next morning<br />
                    <br />
                    All met in the Hall<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : now I am going<br />
                    <br />
                    K : take this key, you will reach quickly and yes after leaving check your phone, remember the surprise<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ok<br />
                    <br />
                    The key was of the bike, it was really fast,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh reached the police station quickly and now was really confident<br />
                    <br />
                    He called the policemen, remembered about he promised and also ask to call suti<br />
                    <br />
                    She arrived,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh then showed the surprise of K on the phone,, it was the original video, where she herself killed her husband,<br />
                    <br />
                    After some time ursh came back<br />
                    <br />
                    K : we were waiting for you so how was the surprise<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : mind blowing bro, you're awesome, btw is something new , as you all were waiting<br />
                    <br />
                    K : follow me<br />
                    <br />
                    K took all of them to a basement through the garage,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : so you all have to create a weapon for yourself, which suits you, and surely I would help,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further all started making weapons under guidance of K and kana<br />
                    <br />
                    Firstly K made a special rod which was simple by looking, whose length was from ground to chest of K<br />
                    <br />
                    K' made a Trident but the spikes were at both the ends, while on side normal looking Trident with curves while other side all 3 spikes were totally straight<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam made a flail with 3 balls<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray made a mace , which had spikes all over it's rounded part<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav made a double sided axe, i.e blade was on both sides at one end and also a shield, and from the center of that shield, a small spear could appear, whenever anything came close to the shield<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki made an urumi whipped sword, which had one whip but on pressing a button on the handle 2 more whips appeared,<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas Ursh made a sword whose blade part had curved zig zag edges, it had a pointed sharp end, but the edges were zig - zag<br />
                    <br />
                    K : Ursh are you sure this would be fine?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh (little excited): yeah, I have added something more, which I will show in the war if needed , and you know what, I have named my sword as " Keris "<br />
                    <br />
                    K : damn nice, wait a minute , I will come back in 2 minutes<br />
                    <br />
                    Then K quickly went outside the basement and then the garage, closed eyes, hands above in air, and a bow came,<br />
                    <br />
                    He went back and gave that bow to Ursh<br />
                    <br />
                    K : take it, it may help you,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ok, if you say<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : kana, haven't you made any or you already had, please show<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : I guess I am enough with this<br />
                    ( showing his flute)<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : btw kana do you know all the powers, K could get<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : according to my knowledge, his power has 5 steps, 3 basic and 2 advanced, he has achived first 2 of them, till now<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ohk<br />
                    <br />
                    Then all moved out<br />
                    <br />
                    After practicing their weapon for 2-3 days<br />
                    <br />
                    K : let's move I guess, pray, you know the location, is it the same or changed?<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : yeah of course, I will check<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray checked the phone<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : ummm, I guess something weird is there,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : say,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : actually, the location has changed , you all know the bermuda Triangle, the location, is showing in between the triangle, in the water , I don't know why and how<br />
                    <br />
                    K : according to my theory, there must be an island which none knows about, and because of weather out there, nothing is shown on the map, so shall we move,,<br />
                    <br />
                    With this part 4 ends<br />
                    <br />
                    Let's see how, K and his team fight in season finale <br /><br />
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>SEASON 2 FINALE (The Final War)</h2>

                <p>
                    <br />
                    So at last all had prepared their weapons to move towards the enemy<br />
                    <br />
                    K ( to everyone): prepare your bags now<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone went to their room,<br />
                    <br />
                    After preparing their bags  , K and paki moved outside the room together but ursh called<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : hey paki, wanna discuss something,<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas K' called K<br />
                    <br />
                    K' (hurriedly) : I just wanted to tell you that I never met kana in my universe, rest is up to you<br />
                    <br />
                    K : hmmm, I will manage<br />
                    <br />
                    So after some minutes all were ready , came out of the house, and were ready to move,<br />
                    <br />
                    But suddenly a bird fleeing nearby died at the edge of the fences<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : what, how did this happen, it was just fleeing and suddenly died,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : remember the security I told,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : please K, I don't need any security which kills innocent<br />
                    <br />
                    K : hey, remember anytime any innocent got punishment due to me<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : no, but this time<br />
                    <br />
                    K : it is a robot, I guess sent by our enemies , just relax,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further they sat in the flying car as the last time , and them flew towards the Bermuda Triangle, after some hours they saw black clouds, with tornado and thuder, so they landed on the BERMUDA island, they landed in a forest area as there was a very large disturbance in air,<br />
                    <br />
                    So as they were moving , K was leading as pray gave the location tracker to him , behind him, paki ursh and K' and behind them raav, sam, pray<br />
                    And behind them kana<br />
                    <br />
                    K : hey kana, why are you moving at last, alone?<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : bro, you are leading everyone, and I am taking care from the last<br />
                    <br />
                    K showed thumbs up<br />
                    <br />
                    Then suddenly a cheetah appeared but K easily stopped it, and threw it away, despite the cheetah wasn't dead but as it was scared so it ran away , he was about to say to everyone that now everything is alright but he saw kana was also fighting with a lion, which at the same time attacked them from behind,<br />
                    <br />
                    After moving for some minutes<br />
                    <br />
                    K : can any of you listen to these weird voices ?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : no, what kinda?<br />
                    <br />
                    K : idk these are weird, even I can feel something, not on my body but I can't explain<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : are the voices of very low pitch,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ummm, yes I guess<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : these are infra sounds or ultra sounds, I guess your 3rd stage,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : why is this so weird, anytime any stage<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : unlocking any power depends upon his skills as well as time, as the matter-antimatter is staying inside his body, loving his body, I mean feeling comfortable, so this depends upon skills, time and need , moreover in this 3rd stage you can also feel vibrations, I mean every atom is vibrating as you know<br />
                    <br />
                    K : hmmm i see , I guess these powers are just unlocked and need to be stronger,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : of course, but shall we move further ,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yess<br />
                    <br />
                    All of them then again started moving through high bushes, pushing them off, after moving for some time ,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : stop, I can hear some foot steps, and something coming near in speed<br />
                    <br />
                    With that suddenly a spear passed just close to face of K<br />
                    <br />
                    And suddenly a group of people around 10 ,with masks on their faces came in front , they had clothes covered to their whole body , even the hairs, and their no body part was visible not even the eyes,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then Sam, pray and raav took out their weapons, which were tung on their backs, and were ready to attack<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : let's attack<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam and pray altogether said, ' yes '<br />
                    <br />
                    K uplifted his arm  stopping them<br />
                    <br />
                    K : friends, really, I was just out for 6-7 days and you, I understand Sam wasn't with me for enough time, but raav and pray both of you, just forgot the rule of goodness<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : broo, I don't wanna justify but both of them have seen really bad things so,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then one of the attackers said ," Khhwaaa’rr ullhh yuhhh… ennna’ghh junn’glllrrhh! "<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what are you saying, I can't understand<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : they are saying, " Who all are you in our jungle " , actually it is a junglee-distorted language, I learn it earlier<br />
                    <br />
                    K : tell them that we are going to the center of the Bermuda triangle, to protest everyone, also ask why they just attacked once and then came in front<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : “Ghhhrraaaa… wehh movvhh tuhh midrrra Brrr’muudrahhh Triangg’luhh… haaaghhh—prrro’ttesshh’kk allhh spirrrritsshh… whhhy juuu strykkhh’d onnnccehh… dennn frrrontarrhh appehhhrh?”<br />
                    <br />
                    one of them replied "Orrhh leedrrhh grruummm’d stoppahh uz… whennhh eyesshh fallhh onnn yuuuhhh alrrhh… "<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : they said their leader stopped them, after seeing you all<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what, but why<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly a person earlier behind came in front,<br />
                    <br />
                    Leader : Charrhh uz pathhh… dennn spirittshhh gibb yuhhh answrrhh to allhh yuurhh whisshh-kvesthh…<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : he is asking to follow them and then they would find answer to each of their questions<br />
                    <br />
                    K : hmmm, everyone remain allert, and follow them<br />
                    <br />
                    While following them<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : why are we following them, maybe it's a danger, we must head towards our location,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : they could attack us, but they didn't, I guess it would be profitable,<br />
                    <br />
                    After some minutes they reached a village area<br />
                    <br />
                    The leader said “Allhh spiritt-onnn crawhh forthhh nowhhh…” and 30-35 people came out from all the houses<br />
                    <br />
                    K and the team were totally shocked as some of them had weird faces, like positioning of nose and eyes were changed, some had distorted faces or arms or legs, one had a large mouth , looking scary, few had slimmest body , while few had animal parts instead of their own,<br />
                    <br />
                    And then they saw that group without masks, 2 had 2 noses, 3 of them had 4 ears, 4 of them had extra large forehead with 2 mouths, while the leader had eyes all over his face, nose , ear and mouth were there but the rest area was covered with eyes,<br />
                    <br />
                    Seeing all of them ,, except k, kana and k' , others closed or tilted their eyes from these people,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : Kana, do you know something about this<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : I only heard rumors that there are people with scary faces, distorted language but I wasn't sure, but on a little search I came to know about this language so I learned it, ignoring the fact whether they are real or not<br />
                    <br />
                    The leader spoke : Meehh spiritzzh had seen yuhh longhh beforrhh<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : K , he is saying that you already know him,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ummm, maybe, but I couldn't..<br />
                    <br />
                    Leader :  Shí éí ash yinishłį́<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : he is saying ...<br />
                    <br />
                    K : that his name is ash<br />
                    <br />
                    K hugged him<br />
                    <br />
                    K : actually he is my childhood friend , I never met him again after my 12th , I didn't even had his contact number, one I got but that was not reachable, ask him how all this happened and how he ended here and why can't he spoke like us now,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana asked this and Ash also replied in that language<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : he was kidnapped by some men, later some tests were made on him, trying to fuse his dna with some other dna, which resulted in this, and not only him, there were many, these all people are the fail results, and after all failing, they were thrown here, so as they had distorted faces or body parts, they couldn't able to speak normally, so with time they designed this language which they could easily speak, and forgot our language<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly paki shouted as the person as the person with the large mouth was near her, he was offering water in a wooden tray , with bowls made of stones, to all of them<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki immediately started saying sorry to him, also held her ears, to show in a sign language<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana spoke something,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : I told that you were sorry, and he also said alright,<br />
                    <br />
                    They all drank water<br />
                    <br />
                    K : tell Ash that they are going to the person who did all this, and we don't have time to rest,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana told Ash about it and ash also said something<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : he is saying to follow him, he would take us to the shore, from where the real destruction begin and from where no one comes back weather through sky or the sea<br />
                    <br />
                    Ash led them, while they were moving, with time the darkness was increasing , after some minutes they reached the shore which was full of noice of thunder, sea, tornado, cyclone ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Leader : " Backhh to rootzzh I trekhh, forrr the voicehh of clan be minehh"<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : he is saying that he has to go back, as he is the leader,<br />
                    <br />
                    K once again hugged him,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : say him that,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : I know, that you will try to fix them<br />
                    <br />
                    K smiled<br />
                    <br />
                    After kana said that,,Ash left,<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly sphinix came there<br />
                    <br />
                    K : bro, how?<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix: how can i leave all of you alone in such a great war, I know swimming, let's goooo<br />
                    <br />
                    Now all of them had to face this big sea, with so many problems,as nothing was visible, except cyclones, thunder, and for sure darkness was there,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' :  I want to ask something, actually, are you sure that the machine would also be here, I mean maybe what if they kept the machine somewhere else,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yes the machine would be here only, as it contains a button which is needed to be pressed at max in 36 hrs or else the machine would rupture,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : but how, you know this,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ok so let me tell something, remember the night before I travelled to the parallel world, I worked for something in the basement, actually it was the blueprint of the machine , which was copied by my robo, 'Steve' , and given to enemies,,<br />
                    In that I set a button, to do that task, and yes remember when the machine was with us, after I came back, I kept the machine at a side , so that it may rupture, but now steve stole the machine and soo.. , maybe they made the machine in hurry, hence it is having a glitch,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : I guess we need to focus on the current situation<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : No, first tell what glitch? Please tell, I have been eager for a long time<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ok see , let the 2 parallel worlds time is represent by<br />
                    1,  2, 3  and<br />
                    1', 2', 3'<br />
                    <br />
                    So if I travelled from 1 then I must reach 3' but I reached 1' which is against the laws, so that's the glitch,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : hmm, I guess let's focus on the situation now<br />
                    <br />
                    K pulled out his rod from back, then called a  metal blade through his powers, then fitted that blade to the top of the rod , and threw it towards the cyclone , but as the rod touched it, suddenly an electric wave emerged from the cyclone towards K, but Kana came in front and saved K<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what, what happened<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : no worries I am fine, an electric wave was going to strike you,<br />
                    <br />
                    K hugged him,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : ok ok, stop,<br />
                    <br />
                    K then called the rod back<br />
                    <br />
                    K : that means this water has electricity inside it, is it due to thoselightnings<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : I don't think so<br />
                    <br />
                    Then all of them saw a face in a tide there,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : damn, I guess it's oculus, it is the most powerful HCM among those simple merged ones<br />
                    <br />
                    K : do you know its weakness?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : Sun is the only weakness, it has no brain, can't come on land<br />
                    <br />
                    K : that means if the sun strikes only then it would be defeated ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : I can call the sun , just stop these cyclones,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : umm, how, moreover how would these cyclones end<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I know, they all must have a single emergence , let me see<br />
                    <br />
                    K took out a single eye binocular, and looked through it,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yes, I was sure, in the middle there is the cyclone through which all of them are connected, and once I reach it, I will end it,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : I am going to end it, I know how to end them, I have already done that<br />
                    <br />
                    K : why, I said I will go, it's too risky for you due to the current, my endurance is better than you, kana be ready, as soon as they end, bring the sun, If you delayed then oculus will recreate them<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana showed thumbs up<br />
                    <br />
                    As K was about to go<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : I am your wife, I am as powerful as you, cause we are one, it's time to show everyone that ,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : for sure, but not this time, understand,, so bye bye,<br />
                    <br />
                    K turned back towards sea<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ummm wait a minute where is Ursh<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly a voice came, it was Ursh, standing on a cliff nearby, moreover he was wearing something on his chest,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : I am having my sword keris I will for sure end them,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further ursh took a run up and jumped,, and as he crossed the line, the cyclone attracted it<br />
                    <br />
                    Now Ursh was inside the cyclone, with his sword in his hand , he was swirling now<br />
                    <br />
                    Electric waves were attacking him but those coming near the chest were diffused due rubber armor, and the rest he was hitting with his sword, but these were coming from all directions, and their intensity was increasing as he move towards the mid<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas at shore<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : he can't do it alone, try to protect him but don't call or attract him,<br />
                    <br />
                    K was moving left and right thinking what to do<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yes, my 3rd stage, I can feel vibrations, that means I can control them too<br />
                    <br />
                    While Ursh finally reached the mid cyclone but as he entered it his armor broke down, and now current waves attacked him again and again from back and front, and after 5-6 strikes he lost his sense and stopped there, after a minute he started pushing towards the eye, while being unconscious he was moving towards that region, it was due to K, he sent vibrations by focussing, and now Ursh reached the calm region but still unconscious<br />
                    <br />
                    All were praying for Ursh,<br />
                    <br />
                    Next a scene came where K was saying to Ursh, " If I am alive how can anything happen to you, "<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly Ursh woke up as it was his dream, which made him stand again<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh saw himself in the calm region and with that he stroke keris to the point, and with that everyone saw cyclones decreasing their size<br />
                    <br />
                    K : kana, do what you said<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : I will do something and if I stopped clouds will come back if the monster didn't end up<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana started playing his flute and with that all the clouds were going, and sun appeared , and during that K with his attraction power pulled Ursh ,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : take some rest bro<br />
                    <br />
                    everyone was relaxed for a moment after listening to the flute but the sun being there but nothing was happening to the monster as they could still see the face in the tide<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : we need to do something, see kana is sweating,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : I have an idea, maybe it could work<br />
                    <br />
                    Then pray told that in K's ears<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I will try<br />
                    <br />
                    K closed his eyes, again trying to attract something, it was difficult for him to do, nothing was happening, he was using so much of his power as such he himself started vibrating<br />
                    <br />
                    Finally everyone saw a big ball of fire coming towards them, which stroke thr sea monster and so a blast happened, water splashed,<br />
                    <br />
                    And now all of them could see a normal ocean<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana stopped<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : but how bro, what was that<br />
                    <br />
                    K : solar flare of sun, I attracted it,<br />
                    <br />
                    K then saw through the binocular and said, " Friends island is there "<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana then called his flying car, everyone again sat on it and flew towards it while sphinix swimmed<br />
                    <br />
                    After everyone reached on the main island<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : friends... Listen, my sword is behaving a little differently,, see<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana touched the blade for a moment ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : did you add some absorbing semiconductors in this <br /><br />

                    Ursh : yeah, yes,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : it absorbed the electric currents and along, you made it strike the main part, so it can do electric attacks<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : wow bro<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : yeah nice<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana: listen listen, he has to identify the correct method, I mean if you think that he will just swirl his sword and currents may go, then no, or not even if you attack someone directly, he may not feel shocks, you have to find the way,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : ok, I will try<br />
                    <br />
                    K : hey everyone look, there is nothing here, no trees, no bushes, no one just a big ground somewhere green and somewhere sandy<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : let's move, following the location,<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone started moving further towards the center, still they were near the shore,<br />
                    <br />
                    After 8-10 steps they felt disturbance in the the ground, a little shaking,<br />
                    <br />
                    A big wall slowly came from inside the ground and went high above, and when it was on ground level, 50-60 men, and 1 girl with mask came<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : it's anya, I mean I never saw her face, but the men, and structure of her face are same,<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas when the wall was little above a gorilla man jumped, as sand monster took form from the sand, and the big gorilla, with sand and fire on his body came,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : these 2 are simple hcm and you all know that special merged one,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : be ready guys, it's time to fight,, sphinix, you just focus on breaking the wall, we all will handle others, let's goooo<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone took out their weapons , and rushed<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas except that special merged HCM and anya all others rushed towards them, some had simple swords, while others were bare handed, while anya had whip in one hand and laser gun in other,<br />
                    <br />
                    Now sam, pray, K' started fighting with those men, sphinix went near the wall a little away from the war,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki went towards the sand monster and Ursh towards the gorilla<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav went towards anya,<br />
                    <br />
                    K and kana towards that special merged gorilla,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana teased the monster and took him away from the battle field<br />
                    <br />
                    While pray and sam easily were easily making all of them lose their senses,<br />
                    <br />
                    But as Raav rushed towards anay, she removed her mask  , raav stopped for a while<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : do you really think I would stop , don't you dare to seduce me<br />
                    <br />
                    While saying this he was thinking ( have I seen her before)  but still he again rushed, she attacked him with laser but raav dodged  , he reached near her, ready to attack with his axe, but she wrapped her whip at the handle of the axe and pushed, and the axe fell near her feet<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : like wise you will fall at the end<br />
                    <br />
                    She dropped her gun, put whip at back and took the axe<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : let's see,l don't need any weapons to fight with you,<br />
                    <br />
                    She attacked him with the axe, but raav made a flip and went other side<br />
                    <br />
                    And at this moment K saw her face and rushed towards them<br />
                    <br />
                    K : broo , she is anya<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : I know<br />
                    <br />
                    K : remember the girl, you met once in my Institute<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya attacked them but K held the axe, took it and pushed anya away<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : oh yeah, I remembered<br />
                    <br />
                    K : she is one of the fake and toxic feminists, I thought when I made an official debate with her in front of camera, after that she would stop but she ..<br />
                    <br />
                    K : oh I forgot something, fight with her, I am going<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya suddenly attacked raav at his back with the whip<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav turned<br />
                    <br />
                    Anya : so, how is my revenge,<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile paki was attacking it but even after touching him, nothing was happening to the sand monster as if any of his part was destroying at the same moment it was reconstructing<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas K saw kana was in trouble and now couldn't handle him for more time  ,  k attacked it suddenly, but still it attacked K and K hit the ground, and due to K's power monster also fell but didn't got hurt<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas Ursh tried to attack the gorilla man but gorilla with his one punch made him fall away near paki<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : take out the material I kept in sidepockets of your bag<br />
                    <br />
                    Saying that he again went to fight while paki took out, these were 3 load stones, she fitted them at tip of the 3 blades, of her sword, and attacked the monster<br />
                    <br />
                    That monster attacked K with sand and kana with fire, kana dodged but K got trapped in sand , kana helped him come out<br />
                    <br />
                    While Ursh , this time dodging it's attacks, attacked him, and it so beacame weak and fell at his knees, took out lead powder from his bag and put It inside his mouth , it fainted<br />
                    <br />
                    Now kana started playing flute, and the monster also started listening to it calmly,<br />
                    <br />
                    While paki attacked the monster, it now swirled and converted back to sand ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh it's weakness was magnetic field<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh came, saying yes collected that sand in a jar and then threw the jar inside the sea,<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly they saw that something was happening in that gorilla and suddenly converted to a very weak man with little hair left on body<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas K was thinking what to do and suddenly got an idea,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : stop bro, give me a jump<br />
                    <br />
                    As kana stopped, the monster roared very loudly  but at the same time, k with the help of kana jumped high, and attacked his rod inside it's mouth, and so it came on knees<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly Ursh came<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : to kill him use radiations but do we really need to kill him<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly sphinix came held the monster and threw it in the seas in a different direction from where they came,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinix : see, the wall is broken already,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what happened to anya<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : see there<br />
                    <br />
                    All the 50 men along with Anya were tied,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further all entered through the big hole but saw that flying wolf faced monster along with 2 monsters, one made of wires, and other from plant<br />
                    <br />
                    While a group of men and women in animal position<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : one is human-plant and other is AI-plant fusion<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : and those are Canibals<br />
                    <br />
                    K : remember these are not humans, cannibalism is totally devilish act ,<br />
                    <br />
                    All of them tried to bite any of them but each time failed as one saved other<br />
                    <br />
                    And with time all of them were unconscious, as raav, paki, and Ursh either made them unconscious or cut their arms or legs<br />
                    <br />
                    While sam broke plant-AI into pieces with his flail with 3 balls ,<br />
                    <br />
                    While pray made human-plant slower with his mace and suddenly K' ripped it off with his Trident  while paki and Ursh Together confuses the monster but still couldn't defeat it,<br />
                    <br />
                    K suddenly observed something,  he said something in the ears of Ursh,<br />
                    <br />
                    With the help of K, Ursh jumped high and held the monster from behind, covered his eyes, the monster was panicking, and as ursh was above and little  controlled over him , as the monster reached the sea area, ursh made him dive into sea, as it's wings touched water, it started sinking while Ursh came back<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam, pray and sphinix had destroyed the wall till then<br />
                    <br />
                    And then they went further and now they saw, humotardiloxian with cybrain and tardihuman, a group in totally black costume and a group in totally white costume, 5 more small groups one in red, one in blue, one in yellow, one in pink and last in brown,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : I know, they are atheists<br />
                    <br />
                    K : so, let's defeat them,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh went towards cybrain,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray went towards tardihuman<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav went near humotardilixian<br />
                    <br />
                    While K, paki, Sam, kana, raav were fighting atheist<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray attacked tardihuman with his mace at its chest but nothing happened to it,<br />
                    <br />
                    While Raav with his axe was just cutting their hands, so that they couldn't attack,<br />
                    <br />
                    While paki with her whip, was attacking their legs to make them fall, or holding the wrists with the whip, pulling towards her and attacking at their stomach with her knees,<br />
                    <br />
                    But suddenly 6-7 men covered her, she attacked with her sword but that sword only held  3 of them  ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile Kana was fighting with bare hands<br />
                    <br />
                    And K with his op ' danda '<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas as ursh rushed towards cybrain, with his sword, but cybrain with his 4 thin arms, held his sword and started passing current<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas humotardilixian was little heavy on K' but K' was still fighting<br />
                    <br />
                    On the other hand the 4th one attacked paki on her hands and made her leave her weapon and now everyone was going to attack her<br />
                    <br />
                    But K saw this, he used his power of attraction and pulled paki towards him, out of their cover, both of them saw each others eyes, but didn't say anything , now K in full anger held the rod from one end, himself flipping in air, swirled the rod like hitting someone in air, and with that a laser in shape of a chakra came out , K repeated that 4-5 times, and now as those lasers touched the atheists, they felt electric current and got stunned,<br />
                    <br />
                    While pray called sam and now both of them with their weapons attacked tardihuman, one at chest and other at head, with that it died,<br />
                    <br />
                    Cybrain was passing current, but nothing was happening so it left the sword , but ursh knew it's weakness so somehow he went behind him and switched off him,<br />
                    <br />
                    While kana, k and paki had defeated all of the atheists,<br />
                    <br />
                    All of them came near K' who was going to be crushed under the feet of the big monster,, but at the right time K attracted him a little so that he would slide a little away,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : at least we can do one thing, then sign something with his hands,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then paki In stealth went behind it, held one of his 4 tentacles with her 3 bladed urmi<br />
                    <br />
                    Monster stopped for a while<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : now<br />
                    <br />
                    With that K, raav and ursh, broke the 3 tentacles with their weapons, while paki at the same time cut the first one,<br />
                    <br />
                    Toxic gas being released from the broken part, it's metal chest was getting opened and at that time K' jumped and with his special Trident attacked at it's core, it's heart and now it came on knees, it's eyes were open but it wasn't responding,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then all of them saw Sphinx, who was just relaxing after breaking the wall ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinx : sorry but I didn't feel the need to come<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone came near him and hugged him,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further through the opening they crossed, but now there was no wall, and no one, but suddenly the flying tiger came down as it was earlier flying,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : it's the strongest of all, he needs no one,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then the tiger attacked a large fireball towards them, mainly towards paki, but covering others too<br />
                    <br />
                    But before fire could touch any of them Sphinx came in between and saved them, nothing muchh happened to him,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sphinx in anger rushed towards the monster<br />
                    <br />
                    But wait what , before anyone could think of anything, the tiger held Sphinx from the neck, and separated its neck from body,, Sphinix died<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone rushed towards its dead body<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : no, you can't die, you were like my brother, no no no, K do something, at least kana you do something, you are so positive and magical , please<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : he was my friend , I can understand what you are feeling but I can't bring a dead back, but... K call the bow I gave, and ursh give me keris, its over now<br />
                    <br />
                    K and ursh gave kana as he said,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana taking them ran, jumped in air and used keris like the arrow of a bow and attacked the monster, keris was going too furiously, despite the tiger attacking his large fireball, also used a strong ice block as his cover ,  roared but tearing everything Keris attacked at its heart, it the monster completely faded as if the sword totally absorbed the monster,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I guess we need to dig to reach them<br />
                    <br />
                    But as K said so earth started shaking and they saw , a big circle opening in the middle and then they saw something coming out, as it was coming out they saw it's  face which was very large,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : attack together<br />
                    <br />
                    They all attacked him but all their weapons failed,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then we saw head 1 , head 1' , head 2 and head 2' were sitting inside its brain and controlling this large monster,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : I have an idea, but for that we need the machine,, please trust me<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray and raav together said, " I will go "<br />
                    <br />
                    K confirmed them, and said to come before the opening gets closed,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray and raav quickly went, it was totally dark,<br />
                    <br />
                    While above the ground they all heard a sound , " This is made of every species and every element "<br />
                    <br />
                    Surrender Or else it may definitely kill you despite it wasn't completely out yet<br />
                    <br />
                    While pray and raav saw the machine but the weird thing was in a total dark room that area was glowing<br />
                    <br />
                    Both went near it, but as they forwarded their hands  they felt shock, and so retreated<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav (holding the hand of pray): pray please don't leave it, just pull me as I say<br />
                    <br />
                    Then raav quickly went inside the bright area, he was feeling electric shock was getting pulled but as raav after held the machine pray pulled him, it was difficult but after a little struggle they managed<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray kept raav on his back and ran,, and held the ground part , climbed over it which was going above and so they came on surface ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray kept raav aside,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what happened to him ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : nothing much, take it,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : as I know, if K gets more and full power he would defeat it, so if I and k held this machine together and switched on it, then instead of travelling in each other's world we may reach the neutral world, which separates the 2 , he will get neutral matter there which if enters his body then he may get powers<br />
                    <br />
                    K : only if kana allows<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : no, I will never,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : no other choice,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : you are free from my side, do what you feel better ,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : sorry kana, I know it's wrong but I have to go<br />
                    <br />
                    K and K' held the machine, switched it on and with that disappeared ,<br />
                    <br />
                    They were in total darkness, floating<br />
                    <br />
                    K took the trident from him, made a cut at his chest, and as one particle of neutro matter entered  the cut got healed,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : let's go<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : help me , this world has trapped me<br />
                    <br />
                    K saw K' was stuck somewhere as if something held his hands from behind, so K went near him<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile in the real world , the monster was whole out, it had wings, many things on the body as if really made of each specied and even AI too, and was written OMNOXAR and below it HCM - 001 on its body<br />
                    <br />
                    It was speaking in 2 voices the voices of 4 heads, as in pair of 2 had same voices,, the monster was attacking, they were dodging<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki shouted : what the hell you want why all of you are so bad<br />
                    <br />
                    With that a voice came , " No we did nothing bad " It was of head' 1<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : your intentions were bad, you made these monsters, and for that ruined so many lives,<br />
                    <br />
                    Head' 2 : no we didn't<br />
                    <br />
                    At same time<br />
                    Head 2 : yes we did , so what<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki and others were confused,<br />
                    <br />
                    Head ' 1 : bro jump,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that head' 1 and head' 2 came out and ran towards paki and others<br />
                    <br />
                    Head'1 : wait wait , we aren't enemies, in our universe we did and made everything for good purpose and good intentions, and when came here thought you all are evil but now we came to know, that you all are good like us,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : if you both are good that means intentions get reversed in that universe which means K'<br />
                    <br />
                    As he spoke that they all heard a deadly laugh<br />
                    <br />
                    They all saw K' flying in aur while K fell at ground with a black clouded knike inside his chest<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh came near K,his eyes were closed, kept his head on his lap, suddenly saw that the knife had disappeared in the atmosphere, while a voice came<br />
                    <br />
                    NOW I AM THE GOD OF THIS WHOLE REALM<br />
                    <br />
                    It was K' in air with an evil smile<br />
                    <br />
                    With this season finale ends, let's see what destruction K' will do in the grand finale of empty spaces season 2 <br /><br />
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>GRAND FINALE
                    (the ultimate war)

                </h2>

                <p>
                    <br />
                    So at last we saw K' betrayed them, got ultimate power whereas K was lying on Ursh's lap while K' disappeared along with HCM-001<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : wake up, wake up, please bro, wake up, I promise I will never hesitate from you,, that was the last time, please<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : what do you mean,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : actually when we were about to leave ursh discussed with me about K' that , he was little different because K would never be on knees in front of any girl, just to be sorry for a small thing where he wasn't much wrong, moreover K' was ignoring whenever ursh tried to talk about the glitch in the machine, and few more like that, but ursh hesitated to tell that to K, as he throught K and K' are same so K may get hurt<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : yes, K please wake up, I promise I will never hesitate in any condition<br />
                    <br />
                    Only if you remain on your promise<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly K opened eyes and spoke,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : you promised, so never ever again hesitate from me<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone quickly hugged K<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : why, just why<br />
                    <br />
                    K : if ursh or you have just told me once, I would be attentive against K', but still,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : I am very happy you are safe but what was that black thing inside your chest, which disappeared and<br />
                    <br />
                    K : stop stop, let me stand first, I will answer all of your questions, ..... So, after I got neutro matter, it wasn't activated, as I needed to come back to this universe but I saw K' being trapped but actually he had a knife made of neutro matter which he inserted in my chest, which absorbed  all the 3 , and further he inserted them in himself, so now he thinks I am dead , but actually you must thanks kana as before going he signed from eyes not to go, and so I was a very little attentive, and here comes the twist, while fighting those monsters, I unlocked my 4th stage that was, control inside whole body, I could see myself from inside and even control everything, so I already setup in my body to heal myself, so despite he took all 3 of them, but my all wounds were healed and I needed to act till I was confirmed that he has gone, and yes he with his powers also teleported HCM-001 along both the heads<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : but what would he get by doing all so<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I don't know,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : no problem but what's our next step<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : I have an idea, see according to K',  K is.. I mean we can fool him, and do something<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : yes, maybe you come in front of him, suddenly, he may panic<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : or you take time to train yourself, till we will handle<br />
                    <br />
                    K(shouts) : STOP!  ,, we will do nothing,, let's go back to our base<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : that means you quit this battle<br />
                    <br />
                    K : kana, I<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana: just say yes or no<br />
                    <br />
                    K : yes<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : ok,, then I am going to defeat them,, will any of you come with me?<br />
                    <br />
                    Each person in K's team stayed silent and stepped back,<br />
                    <br />
                    But Head'1 and Head'2 came and decided to go<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : ok, so i am going my way, you can go yours,, and yes take this car as a gift,, I have another one,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana and both heads' went on one car, while K and team on the other one to different directions<br />
                    <br />
                    K and the team reached the base,<br />
                    Cleared all the security checks,,<br />
                    <br />
                    While they were on the stone path, k stopped everyone<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what happened, none of you spoke in the way, relax I freed all of you from this burden of fight<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : if you are thinking we all support your decision then you are wrong, we just supported you, as we learnt from you to be with your friend in any situation, if he is wrong try to change his path, never change the friend,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray moved inside , with sad face<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : we all are very upset about your decision,  you shouldn't have quit,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav also moved inside<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : were you afraid when you saw death from so close, I don't know man, just leave it, enjoy,, let the world suffer<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam too went inside<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki without talking about anything or looking at him went inside,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh hugged him and during that said , " It's ok"<br />
                    <br />
                    And went inside<br />
                    <br />
                    K was alone, he smiled in air,, went inside, no one was in Hall, he went inside his room,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I know, you are also upset that I quit, but I<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : again explanations, do you think I am upset as you choosed to stop,, no,, just because I felt you this decision wasn't totally yours, you compromised your character , I don't know for what, moreover my K never accept defeat, in any condition<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I am not defeated,, they all left the battlefield,, and I just decided not to fight any more,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh, great,, both of us know, that you said this just to satisfy your heart,, anyways, rest,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K came near her face, kissed at forehead and said good night,, and smiled<br />
                    <br />
                    It was around midnight, Ursh wasn't able to sleep so he went upstairs to the roof but as he saw the locks of the door were open ,, the door was just folded,, he prepped and saw K out there ,, he was smiling and suddenly said, " why God , why "<br />
                    <br />
                    With this Ursh remembered the exact moment that happened when K lived double life ( one day perfect and other day imperfect ) at night K was crying and saying the exact words, but that time he was crying and this time he is smiling,, moreover ursh himself stepped back at that time but this time Ursh entered<br />
                    <br />
                    K : oh, you are awake,, I know due to what I did,, I took away yours sleep,, but chill, in a day or 2 everything will be back to normal,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : let me speak,, I am awake,, not because of you,, and as you took promise from me not to hesitate,, I was worried about Kana,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ummm, he is really powerful<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : but we haven't seen his powers, had you? , he is mysterious to us,, while K',, when you had powers at basic, they were awesome,, and K' had advance level of them with some more powers,, will kana be able to match his powers, as K' is really unstoppable now,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what I think is Kana may not take direct fight,, he is really intelligent,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : let's see, btw why we're you smiling in air just like thinking something but complaining to God<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I am not hesitating to tell, but the time will surely tell,, come on let's sleep,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Both of them went to sleep<br />
                    <br />
                    Next morning K came into the Hall,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : come on guys,, come out,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone came<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what I ak thinking is let's just not life a boring life,, let's do something interesting,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : what do you mean<br />
                    <br />
                    K : let's do something enjoyable,, not against health, but which makes our heart happy,, let's dance, play games, sing, art work or anything like that<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : literally bro,<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : why aren't you worried about the world<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : bro, it's you who always says to be real, so instead of acting just be real<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : exactly,, just talk whatever you are feeling, reason for your decision,, we shall never judge you<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : but at least we have the right to know<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : that ,why did you quit<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : and I don't think so it's because you scared the death<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh shouted, " Stop guys, I know we all have a number of questions, but please give him time to be normal,, time to accept his own decision,, for sure he said to be real, but when you need a change, at start you try to have that change in yourself is also what he says"<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : but<br />
                    <br />
                    K shouted, " OKAYS "<br />
                    <br />
                    K : if you all want to know then listen,,<br />
                    <br />
                    The moment the knife got injected into me, I saw my whole life within a second,, luckily I survived,, for sure I am not scared of death, and have no problem if I lost my life in this battle but, I am not ready to lose any of you, I already lost...<br />
                    <br />
                    ( K fell on his knees with tears in the eyes)<br />
                    <br />
                    Vay and cheg,, not I can't afford any of you to..<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone came near K,, made him stand,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : we also can't afford to lose you,, please never ever talk like that again<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : yes bro,, and<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : please don't cry<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : no, let him cry,, I guess he is crying after a very long time,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : if I am right then the moment he got backlash and he decided to let all others go to hell,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : yesss,<br />
                    <br />
                    K cried by keeping his eyes at shoulders of Ursh<br />
                    <br />
                    After some time<br />
                    <br />
                    K : don't you all feel,it's been a long day since we were fighting, let's go somewhere, bike rides,in nights, long grass,just resting in peace,, and , is it ok for all of you, about my decision<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone just noded<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : But I am a little worried about ..<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly a large noise came from outside , like someone hit the door very hard<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone quickly went towards the door and opened it ,<br />
                    <br />
                    It was kana lying down, most of his body was red , scratches, clothes torned , eyes closed<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki quickly went towards him, kept his head in her lap,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : hey, wake up, come on guys let's take him inside,, raav please quickly treat him,,<br />
                    <br />
                    As they were going to approach him, suddenly kana coughed,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : no, no need,, I mean now nothing can be done, I can see my death,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : what the hell are you saying,, raav come,, everyone take him inside<br />
                    <br />
                    K quickly went towards him, held his arm but kana made k leave it<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : leave it, who are you, don't dare to touch me ,, I warn..<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana closed his eyes,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : raav please check what happened to him, I can't feel his heart beat or him taking breath , neither the pulses,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav also checked the pulses and assured that kana's pulses are not beating,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki stood up and shouted at K<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : it's all because of you,, to save us you sacrificed the whole world, you always said to be selfless and became selfish,, you are mur..<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : pause, you are speaking too much I guess<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh yeah, how could you find k wrong, it's because of his decision that kana is<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : death is inevitable,, k never wished that then how is he guilty<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh,, then if this happened to any of us, then would you react same,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : STOP !!!<br />
                    <br />
                    Yes it's my fault,, I am responsible,, if I had moved along kana, then, this,, paki you are totally right,, please punish me,, slap me, punch me, or whatever you want,, because of my selfish nature,, we lost.. I took decision in a hurry,, and he too did so,, at least he could give me some time,, I am not blaming him, but for sure I am wrong,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh: why worrying bro,, he died today we would die tomorrow as K' would end up this whole universe soon,, why taking tension,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : no,, he can never breach this security level<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : he is same as you,, he knows more than you, he knows what can you think or what you are going to,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I know he can never,,<br />
                    <br />
                    " He can "<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly kana woke up and said<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : after destroying the galaxies, stars, planets etc he would be powerful enough to break it, and yes I was acting to make you realize what a big mistake you were going to do ,, but if you still resisted this acting would be reality,, none of us would be ,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : oh! I am glad you are alive, but how you stopped your<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I guess you are right,, ummm..<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : paki, I know that skill, and K, are you ready?<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : I want to say something,, we all, me, paki, raav, pray and sam will stay here, none of us would come with you<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : whatt, how can you say that,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : we all are a liability for him,, if we were there he wouldn't concentrate properly,, remember paki, while we were fighting monsters and those people,, K saved you,, that means his focus was still on us,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : I guess ursh is right<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : but what if K' came here and kidnapped any of us, to blackmail K<br />
                    <br />
                    K : once I go, I will remove myself from the security check,, after that I can't even enter,, all of you just stay inside the fences,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : yes yes why not , we will leave you inside the mouth of death and be safe here , relaxing<br />
                    <br />
                    With that paki went inside<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : I agree with paki,,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that Sam also left<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I will make them understand,, btw kana i forgot to ask,, where are the parallel world heads, who went along with you,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : actually,, ummm<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : please don't say any bad news<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : listen ,, as we went to fight K' and we reached their location,, they are still on earth ( planning to move out )<br />
                    <br />
                    What I saw there was<br />
                    <br />
                    K' was in the air and saying something to them,, and as they saw us,<br />
                    <br />
                    Both the heads went inside HCM 001<br />
                    <br />
                    While K' smiled,<br />
                    <br />
                    I went towards K'  , jumped, and attacked him, but he with his powers stopped me,, I was in the air for a minute,, trying to break the invisible wall created by him, but failed and landed on the ground,,<br />
                    <br />
                    While head'1 and head'2 were trying to make hcm 001 fall down due to it's big height,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile a fight was going on between me and K',, it was difficult for me even to touch him,, but I was initially protecting myself,, but suddenly he attacked so hard that I flew away and hit a big stone,, due to that the stone slid a little,, it was a cave,<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile hcm 001 had sent big snakes,, which tied around head'1 and head'2,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas inside the cave I saw the machine,, through which multiverse travel is possible<br />
                    <br />
                    I thought there must be some protection ,, maybe invisible,, but I easily entered, yes I felt something,, but still crossed and before the snake could eat them ,I sent both the heads back to their universe,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas as I sat in the car I saw K' meditating,, and as I know and saw, he was attracting energy,, and within 5 days he would extract all the energy and either will destroy the earth or go in space to destroy or extract it , but if his meditation before the 5th day , he would loose all energy gathered,, and yes from those 5 days 1 day has already completed, we need to hurry,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone was quiet for a while about what Kana said,,<br />
                    <br />
                    After a minute<br />
                    <br />
                    K : let's prepare<br />
                    <br />
                    After that again a harsh training of K with kana started in which ursh and paki were also helping ,, in days and nights,, whereas raav and pray were in the bunker making something where they earlier made their weapons,, whereas sam was working on 2-3 computers together,<br />
                    <br />
                    So after 3 days all of them were ready, K had done enough training,, raav and pray gave him and kana a suit,, it was open and flying in air,<br />
                    Both suits were black, one had green strips and other had light blue,, green one had a blue coloured crown emoji at back while blue one had a green flute emoji at the back,<br />
                    while raav and pray told the details as such<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : this is one of the best suits of all,, with plank technology ,, as it touches you, it connects with you,, you can even fly as you want , it can read dna of any species very easily, and give you details of that species,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : despite you both having different suits , but within that with a command you can talk to each other, which no one else can listen to, it is resistant to fire, water, and even thunder, we tried to make it as light as possible,, despite too hard to break,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : wow, in such a low time, both of you learnt so much,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : thanks, actually we already had a framework, but never knew how to apply that, and when you taught us the way to make our own weapons, we did so,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : one more thing ,,we also added a food command,, if the war went on for many days,, we know, you can manage the sleep,, and yes for sure you can manage the food also, but in case you feel low due to hunger, with a food command , a pin will get injected inside your skin,, and complete the need of food, <br /><br />

                    Raav : while with a command of drink water, a pipe will come and fit inside your mouth,, and so.. adding on it can persist in space also, but remember,, oxygen, food and water are just limited,, so use them carefully, at max 30 minutes is possible to survive in space,, and in case you need more time,, come back to earth for 10 minutes and oxygen for 30 minutes will refill, <br /><br />

                    K : literally, you did a lot within 3 days,, amazing,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : thanks<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I guess it's time to go<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : I helped you don't mean I am ok about what you are doing,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I know<br />
                    <br />
                    With that K kissed paki on forehead, and said bye,,<br />
                    Hugged all others,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ok bye, so I am removing my data from the security,, and only ursh can refill it, only if you are sure that we won, and I am real ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana and K went flying in the air,<br />
                    And following kana they reached the location of enemies,<br />
                    <br />
                    Both just removed the mask,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I guess it's time to fight<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : for sure<br />
                    <br />
                    With that both of them wore the mask again,,flying in air rushed towards K' who was meditating and attracting energy inside himself,<br />
                    <br />
                    But before they could reach him,, HCM 001 came in between , both stopped suddenly,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : wow, you must appreciate raav and pray, this is best suited with the brain, and even easy to handle, we didn't even need any training,<br />
                    <br />
                    ( they flew far from hcm 001)<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I guess your training also made me handle this suit easily<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : so what's the plan, how to defeat it<br />
                    <br />
                    K : don't you think our priority must be to distract K'<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : will it let us reach there,<br />
                    <br />
                    K then closed eyes and raised hand in the air<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : broo ...... you forgot, you don't have your powers,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : oh yeah,, how could I,, actually I was thinking for a rope, ykiyk<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : hmmm,<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly a voice came<br />
                    <br />
                    " Command your suit as 'I want a rope ' "<br />
                    <br />
                    K : ummm, raav, I heard his voice<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : me too<br />
                    <br />
                    " Yes you are right, this is only me,, this is also a feature developed by sam, we all can see whatever you are seeing or discussing " - voice of raav<br />
                    <br />
                    K : from the home,, amazing but sam, why bro<br />
                    <br />
                    Sam : broo, I wanted to install the best AI inside your suit, and yes it's the AI developes by you only, but I learnt it to handle, moreover this suit due to your AI will react accordingly in critical situations, and yes, the thing we can listen and see, it's cause warning given by Paki<br />
                    <br />
                    K : expected,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana: please stop guys, we are left with very less time, stop the talk, and yes it's ok what you did but please only talk when needed to explain the functions,, no other talk should be done,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : okkk sir,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : Hey, KURPPACV , I want a rope<br />
                    <br />
                    Then the suit started scanning surroundings, and quickly went inside the jungle taking K along<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : literally, what a name given to you AI<br />
                    <br />
                    K then reached a tree, and a very large snake was there, so K quickly hide behind<br />
                    <br />
                    K : it's a snake,, I guess there was no rope nearby, so this suit end me here<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : don't even think to take it,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : of course I will never harm any creature for my own benefits, wait what this snake is going to attack a nest, I must save it,<br />
                    <br />
                    As the mouth of the snake was near the nest with eggs, K held the snake from behind and threw it away, and as he threw it K saw something<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile Kana was dodging HCM 001 , as it was punching kana, but kana was just dodging ,  but kana ended at a mountain where he had no option to dodge the attack ,<br />
                    <br />
                    HCM 001 :  It's your end,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana started laughing suddenly<br />
                    <br />
                    HCM 001 in anger started moving fastly towards kana, with wrist up as if ready to punch kana, but with the very first step it fell down,<br />
                    <br />
                    K had tied its legs with broad and long vines,<br />
                    <br />
                    Further K quickly went towards K'<br />
                    <br />
                    But as he reached near him,, K got a great push, before reaching him, so K hit the mountain wall very hard,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile HCM 001 stood up, it created 2 fire tornados and sent both of them towards kana and K<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : command is ' Fire suit on '<br />
                    <br />
                    Both of them said the command and with that the logo of both of them at back changed to 🔥<br />
                    <br />
                    With that tornadoes took both of them inside,<br />
                    Now it was converted to one large tornado in which both of them were swirling<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : what to do now<br />
                    <br />
                    K : To the focus<br />
                    <br />
                    Further both of them held hands together, rushed like a fireball went outside the tornado with great speed,, and came near K', cause of kana that shield didn't work, while K punched K', despite couldn't touch him but a small blast happened , K and kana were pushed little far, while K' opened eyes, saw deadly towards HCM 001 , and with that both the heads were thrown out of it while hcm 001 also stopped<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : both of you, couldn't hold these 2 just for some moments, I don't need any of you,, i will do everything myself<br />
                    <br />
                    K' closed eyes,, went high in air, and sent some rays towards hcm 001 ,  with that hcm 001 got excited and roared ,<br />
                    <br />
                    HCM 001 reduced it's size, made some moments with hands,, and suddenly many creatures came from the ground and many just appeared from air<br />
                    <br />
                    There were thousands of these creatures among them those 20 monsters  were also there ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Both K and Kana were shocked,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : We are just 2 ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : you can never defeat them<br />
                    <br />
                    K : why,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana: cause you always hold back, you always try not to kill anyone,, but at present, we need to kill them<br />
                    <br />
                    K : okk, I will try, But<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly some voice came<br />
                    <br />
                    " I guess someone is missing me "<br />
                    <br />
                    It was paki , sam, raav and pray in their suits, paki had white strips, raav had red one, pray had yellow, while sam had orange<br />
                    <br />
                    Not only them but many people,, it was military, not only military, but also common people, there was Anya and her followers, those atheist and their leaders and even the Canibals<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki and others came near K<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : how is the surprise, actually sam and I were working on this, mainly him, contacted your subscribers, we showed and told them the situation, and asked for help,, meanwhile raav and pray contacted our other enemies, and as it was question of our universe they all agreed,<br />
                    <br />
                    Your most loyal subs came here and other ones made such a large pressure on the government, that they had to send the military ,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : wow, never expected so,, but wait what where is ursh?<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : he said he is busy, I guess he still thinks he would be a liability on you, maybe he is right but,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : no need to say further,, let's fight them<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : wait ,, you forgot something,, your special weapon,, you can move towards HCM 001 we will see the monsters<br />
                    <br />
                    K : oh,, I thought my powers I gone, I also forgot about it,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then a proper war started,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Common people had local weapons like axe, chopper, cleaver , khurpi etc, with which they were fighting, while the military were shooting with guns, rifles,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki and team were fighting with main 4 monsters while military with those 16 and common people with other creatures<br />
                    <br />
                    Many of them were getting injured,, but they were dominating the battle<br />
                    <br />
                    As K and Kana were fighting HCM 001 ,, as they were 2 , while it attacked one the other person attacked it, still its attacks were powerful,, but still k and kana could win in some moments,<br />
                    <br />
                    But suddenly K' shouted<br />
                    <br />
                    Folded hands and with a strike opened them,, with that each and everyone of them were thrown backwards, most of them hit the ground or the mountain wall very hard,<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone even K and Kana were injured, The suits were all right, but still they experienced a powerful shake which made them injured,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' and HCM 001 together sent a huge ball of energy which also had powers of the 5 elements and sent towards K<br />
                    <br />
                    But before it could reach K<br />
                    <br />
                    A sword came in between and absorbed it , it was a person totally in black suit, then he removed the mask and spoke<br />
                    <br />
                    ' If K is in trouble, how can Ursh not come '<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : so how was the entry<br />
                    <br />
                    K whistled<br />
                    <br />
                    K : Actually everyone already knew , you would definitely come,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : but no one expected when and how,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : so let's gooooo<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : there is a surprise for you,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh whistled<br />
                    <br />
                    And then Ash and all the failed dna projects people came<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : they will manage simple fused monsters,, me and kana will manage HCM 001 , you go towards..<br />
                    <br />
                    K : I know my target, very well,<br />
                    <br />
                    Suddenly 2 voices came together , " We are also with you "<br />
                    <br />
                    It were the 2 heads,<br />
                    <br />
                    Seeing that everyone got courage, and everyone stood up<br />
                    <br />
                    All the loyal fans, Canibals,  atheists, anya and followers, were fighting with the army of new monsters, summoned by HCM 001 , failed projects people , the 2 heads and military were fighting those 16 simple fused monsters,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki, Sam, raav and pray were fighting those 4 special fused monster<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana and Ursh flew towards HCM 001<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile K' flew up in the air in the space<br />
                    <br />
                    K followed him,,<br />
                    <br />
                    After going out of the exosphere K' stopped, and lifted his hand,, and with great speed the Trident made by him came in his hand<br />
                    <br />
                    K also had stopped,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : I guess it's the time to fight,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that a great war started  between K and K'<br />
                    <br />
                    K using his special stick and K' Trident,<br />
                    <br />
                    Both the weapons were, striking each other,<br />
                    Both of them were pushing each other with equal force,,<br />
                    <br />
                    K was attacking but K' was easily dodging whereas many of the attacks of K' were hitting K,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : you can never defeat me I know all of your moves,,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that K' stretched his hand towards K,, and K got attracted towards him,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then from the other hand K' repelled K,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : what, are you using both the powers together<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : nice catch, easily controllable,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that K' just rotated his hands, but K started revolving around him without his will, and with a great impact K was thrown  towards the ground<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : not only 2 but the 3rd one, vibrations  also<br />
                    <br />
                    With that K hit the ground very hard such that a small put also formed,, and even his suit was broken, the helmet part was gone, and various other places were torned<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone in the enemy team and of K stopped<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone in the team of K came in the form of a circle near him ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki, kana, ursh, sam, raav and pray came near his body<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav tried pressing his chest so that his heart beat could start again,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana was just confused<br />
                    <br />
                    And muttering, " How is that possible, are the laws of this whole realm finished "<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana quickly went somewhere, and brought some leaves,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : wait,, he can't die,<br />
                    <br />
                    Then kana put the leaves inside his mouth,,<br />
                    <br />
                    After a few minutes, K finally took breath<br />
                    <br />
                    K : sorry everyone, sorry kana, I lost the battle<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : no, battle is still left, you are still alive,<br />
                    <br />
                    Pray : take my suit,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : take keris ,<br />
                    <br />
                    K was about to leave<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : wait take this also<br />
                    <br />
                    Taking that thing K went in space, where K' was sucking energy,<br />
                    <br />
                    As K reached near K'<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : what, I guess I need to end you completely,<br />
                    <br />
                    K : you lost your chance now come with me<br />
                    <br />
                    Saying that<br />
                    <br />
                    K and K' both disappeared<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile<br />
                    <br />
                    Raav : kana, use the powers to read dna<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana did the same thing,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : Bring cockroaches<br />
                    <br />
                    Everyone in shock " What "<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : and yes in thousands<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh,paki ,sam ,and raav quickly went in different directions,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Came back with big polythenes filled with cockroaches<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana took all of them, and threw the polythenes at different parts like eyes, ears, stomach, head,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : actually they forgot to add dna of cockroach,, which was it's weakness<br />
                    <br />
                    After a few minutes,  HCM 001 blasted ,with that ,all of the other monsters also blasted or just merged on air,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : I just hope K is fine, shall we go to help,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : it's not possible they are in the neutral universe<br />
                    <br />
                    Scene shift to K<br />
                    <br />
                    K : here your powers will not work,<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : but I know very well your all moves,<br />
                    <br />
                    One hand of K was at the back while on the other hand the rod was there, K threw it towards him but K' stopped, it<br />
                    <br />
                    K' : I said I knew, ahhh<br />
                    <br />
                    K had attacked with keris which had some black substance over it,<br />
                    <br />
                    K pulled it out and injected it inside himself<br />
                    <br />
                    While K' was in pain<br />
                    <br />
                    K was shining in the whole black<br />
                    <br />
                    K took the rod, made it sharp from both ends, made it rotate like a chaitra,,<br />
                    <br />
                    Fixed it above keris<br />
                    <br />
                    And threw the combo weapon towards K'<br />
                    <br />
                    The pointed edge of keris hit the stomach while the chakra hit the neck,,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that K' took his last breath, and got dissolved in form of atoms in that black,<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile in the original universe everyone was praying for K<br />
                    <br />
                    And finally K came , and as he touched the ground and took the first step towards the team,<br />
                    <br />
                    K jumped in the air, and his eyes were completely white, but this happened just for a moment<br />
                    <br />
                    K : Love you Friends , love you paki, Love you everyone, it was a grateful life ,  please just never fight with your friends, always be real and trust them, whether I am there or not, never keep grudges for anyone, spread love,<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh : what, why are you speaking as such<br />
                    <br />
                    K ( seeing towards Ursh): I always said I am most mature in friendship but it is you,<br />
                    <br />
                    Paki : please don't speak like that, haven't we won<br />
                    <br />
                    K( seeing towards paki) : I never believed in love , but it was you,, who made me ,<br />
                    <br />
                    Kana : you are kidding, right?<br />
                    <br />
                    K( seeing towards kana) :  take care of my<br />
                    <br />
                    With that , before the last word K turned into atoms and dissolved in the universe<br />
                    <br />
                    Ursh and Paki both shouted , no one could believe their eyes, what had just happened,<br />
                    <br />
                    With that<br />
                    <br />
                    EMPTY SPACES SEASON 2 ENDS<br />
