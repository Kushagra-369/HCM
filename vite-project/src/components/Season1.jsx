                    So in starting we see an interview is going on <br /> With the title ' The knowledge interview ' <br /> Let's we call the person taking interview A <br /> And the person giving it K <br /> So the interview starts <br />

                    A : We welcome you and firstly , how are you? <br /><br /> K : Thanks , I am good and what about you <br /><br /> A : I am also good,, thanks btw for coming,, firstly tell how are you feeling , after reaching so much success in your life <br /><br /> K (little blushes) : thanks for the praise but success is not something it looks like <br /><br /> A : what do you mean <br /><br /> K : I mean one's success can be failure of another and may be success for any 3rd person <br /><br /> A : hmmm, can you tell how <br /><br /> K : I will explain you with an example ,, let 3 persons be A(not you) , B and C <br /> There is a competition <br /> Let A has power to defeat B but will loose from C <br /><br /> And first round is between B and C <br /><br /> Then then success of B is success and A and failure of C whereas <br /> Success success of C is failure of both A and B <br /><br /> A : hmmm nice ,, it means luck plays a major role ,, does it ? <br /><br /> K : yes luck always plays a role but it depends on you hardwork you did <br /><br /> A : how ,, I mean both are correlated,, it's weird to listen <br /><br /> K : yes , but listen how come <br /><br /> So <br /> Take a situation A,B and C <br /> A has done 50% hardwork <br /> Which means A can defeat C <br /> But it depends on luck whether he can fit C or not whereas B and C depends on luck if compete with each other <br /> And if once lost then out of the match <br /> Moreover depends on luck which 2 will first compete together <br /><br /> So if take cases then a total of 4 cases will come and and after adding then you will get probability of 3/4 which means of you have done 50% hardwork then there are 75% chance of your win <br /><br /> So this is how <br /><br /> Whereas if there are 4 persons and A has done 50% hardwork <br /> Which meant he can definitely defeat one of them <br /> Can defeat with probability 3/4 with 2nd of them <br /> And 1/2 probability with 3rd of them <br /><br /> So now there will be 15 cases and on adding them you get probability 75/96 which is around 78% <br /><br /> So now the 3rd case when there are 5 people <br /> You will definitely defeat 2 of them and other 2 depends on luck <br /> Then there will be 64 cases and on adding them you again get 3/4 which means 75 percent <br /><br /> So it's clear that if you have done 50% hardwork then chances of your win is 75%-80% <br /><br /> But remember this is when other players totally depend on luck when played with each other <br /> And when we see the cases in all then you will get to see that it depends on luck that you will win or not <br /><br /> So more hardwork more chance of your win but <br /> Remember luck will have no role of you have done 100% hardwork <br /><br /> A: oh damn , what an explanation, hope are viewers have understood it ,, so tell now do you consider yourself successful or not <br /><br /> K : not completely as I have to do many more <br /><br /> A : what else , you can done while you achieved so much ,, what's your goal then <br /><br /> K : I DON'T KNOW <br /><br /> A : hmmm , so can you tell how you manage all these things together and what should we call you,, <br /> (to viewers )- those who don't know K is a big youtuber , done many researchers in physics and maths , a good singer , and at last writes his own poetries , books and novels <br /><br /> K : I am youtuber by profession as from there I started to earn money <br /> Researches in science and maths are my passion , singing is something close to my heart , which I do for relaxation whereas I write in free spaces <br /><br /> A : what did you just said free spaces , i guess you mean free time <br /><br /> K : no , I mean free spaces only , but it's the time of day which is not empty, can be used , but you mostly waste , it's not the time where you are relaxing , like travelling, bathing, time before getting sleep or something else. I mostly use that time to write <br /><br /> A: Hmmm , but I guess many people don't have this time on regular basis <br /><br /> K : If universe can have empty apeces then why not you <br /><br /> A : wait what ! What do you mean by that <br /><br /> K : it's just a hint I am giving to you and all the viewers ,, think by yourself,, why should I tell everything <br /><br /> A : Ohk ,, then can you tell about empty heart and empty feelings,, cause some people just sometimes feel empty without any reason <br /><br /> K : yes I know,, I also have gone through that face ,, when I was just 18 , for a large period of time,, at least once in a month I went through that empty feeling phase and at that time , the only thing I could do was to cry . It totally depends on you,, from what thing you get satisfaction,, do that ,, or just cry ,, so by this you would fastly get out of the situation <br /><br /> A : ohk ,, i guess it's enough for now ,, so let's end it ,, it was nice meeting you <br /><br /> K(smiles) : same here but wait ,, you asked out many questions from now let's play a game <br /><br /> A : oh wow ,, why not ,, which game <br /><br /> K : guess the golden ball <br /><br /> A : means <br /><br /> K(taking out 2 identical balls from pocket) : these are 2 balls ,, in 2 halves joint by magnet . <br /> One is golden and other is silver from inside ,, I will see what's in that and will push one ball further i.e according to me you should choose that ball for win ,, so you have to decide to choose the golden ball <br /><br /> A : oh that's a nice game ,, I will definitely try <br /> (Looking to camera) : you all also try to guess <br /><br /> K(seeing the balls from inside and pushing one of them ) : so choose <br /><br /> A(taking the unpushed ball) : oh that's silver one but I was expecting it to be golden one <br /><br /> K : Hmmm , I know what you were thinking,, <br /> You thought someone dumb will push silver ball further , you will choose the other ball, the smarter one will push golden one further to confuse you and you know it so you will choose pushed ball , the more smarter one will push silver ball to double confuse you and you think me to be that one so chose unpushed ball and I knew that what you were thinking about me so I pushed golden ball further and so you got tricked <br /><br /> A: damn bro ,, I am out of this game ,, let's end the interview <br /><br />

                    So after this interview was over <br /> We see K going home but he was on a cycle <br /> On reaching outer gates he had to place thumb on a device to scan <br /> Further on reaching the main door of house he had to answer few questions to enter the house <br /><br />

                    1st question was <br /> there are how many types of universe/ multiverse <br /> He answered : 3 <br /><br />

                    2nd question was <br /> Write 69 in terms of binary codes <br /><br /> And 30 seconds times was there <br /> So he fastly wrote 3,7,15,31,63 and then wrote 1000000 then changed it to 1000101 <br /> Then entered and it was correct <br /><br />

                    And the 3rd question which appeared <br /> Number of ways to write 18 as sum of any number of consecutive integers <br /> He answered 4 <br /><br />

                    And so the gates opened <br /><br />

                    ( Hey you the readers ,, if want to know the solution/process of any of them ,, message me after completing it) <br /><br />

                    After entering the house we see that on entrance there was a sink on right end with a mug to wash hands and on threshold there was area to wash feet through mug <br /> So he did so <br /> And entered the house <br /><br />

                    Then we saw that his 4 persons (one girl, 3 boys) came in the hall ,, and ask him about the interview ,, and so K told them whatever happened . <br /><br /> The girl was his wife named paki ,, rest were his friends , best friend Ursh and other 2 : raav and pray <br /><br />

                    After a little discussion he entered his room with his wife ,, further she asked so how is your research going on about the empty spaces of universe , <br /><br /> He replied, not really good <br /><br /> We all know everything in this universe is made of atoms and these atoms have some space in between them but what further,, nothing good is coming out but still I will try , <br /><br />

                    After eating food he went to his gaming room <br /> Where he earlier played games and made videos <br /> But he does this once a month ,, <br /><br />

                    Then we saw he saw time in his advance watch , it was 3:20:45 pushed 3 objects of that room , 1st one revolved 3 times , 2nd one 4 times and 3rd one at 225 degree but nothing happened , so he further rotate it to few more degrees , then an underground path appeared which lead to the basement <br /><br />

                    So he entered it ,, further he pressed a button which closed the gates <br /> Further he called hey steve , give the news of the 2 days <br /><br /> Further a robot out of nowhere came out and started speaking some researches which were published everyday from labs of different parts of the world ,, <br /><br />

                    Further he started swiping the news on left or right ,, after 10 -15 minutes of this act <br /> A screen got switched on and on that all the news which he had right swiped came on it <br /> Which were also split in the sections of medical, space , war , quantum, inventions , exploration <br /><br /> And he started analysis all of them one by one ,, after an hour later he stopped and pressed 'current topic' which was appearing on that screen <br /><br />

                    Further ' empty spaces ' appeared on that in large letters ,, <br /><br /> Further he said " statt discussion " <br /><br /> So steve came and said " yes sir " <br /><br /> K : as already talked about , everything in our universe has atoms and these atoms have space between them <br /><br /> Steve : yes , and these spaces are more or less depending on the type of matter , whether less or more <br /><br /> K : yeah , but are these spaces also made of something just like atoms are made of matter <br /><br /> Steve : antimatter , but according to scientists if matter and antimatter collided then an explosion is for sure <br /><br /> K : yeah but I can't understand that what I am Missing in all these <br /><br /> Steve : you could only find out only if you will think it yourself, <br /><br />

                    Further everything was silent , K was just thinking,, being pressure on his mind , analysing all the talks . <br /><br /> And suddenly he said 'a layer ,, may be' <br /><br /> With this he said to Steve , " analysis this all ,, I am going now" <br /><br /> And he went upstairs and out of the basement <br /><br />

                    Further to dining table , ate the meal with others , then to his room <br /> Layed down , along his wife was also laying , and a conversation between them started <br /><br /> Aaki : i wanna say something <br /><br /> K : you need not say this line , just say , whatever is in your heart <br /><br /> Aaki : I know , you are doing great things and I really support and appreciate them , but I really miss my original K <br /> I still remember the time where we met after a long time <br /><br /> K : yeah , I too remember we firstly met in 7th and when your left school after 8th we never saw or talked to each other <br /><br /> Aaki : hmmm and after 10 years when my marriage was going on and you were singing there unknowingly just for fun , when everyone was gone and I saw my fionacay cheating on me , and started attacking me when I caught him , you came and saved me <br /><br /> K : i would have done same , even there was someone else in place of you <br /><br /> Aaki : the thing I liked in you ,, and further when I entered this house ,, we first lived as just friends and after 3 years we realised to marry each other ,, <br /><br /> During those 5 years I had seen you like a normal guy with some perfections and some imperfections, but from around last 1 year you have just changed out a day mr. Perfect and the nex kit day .. <br /><br /> K(interrupting her) : no , please no , don't say anything further. <br /><br /> Aaki : okay okay , sorry, I know , you also can't do anything in that , but remember whenever feel you can just cry ,, <br /><br /> And yes I loved you , i love you and will always love you wheather you get changed or not <br /><br /> K : love you too <br /><br /> With this both of them sleeps <br /><br />

                    Next morning K was sleeping till late : around 11 am -12 pm : when woke , after refreshing ate breakfast , then got stuck on tv , further started watching reels on internet , moreover even after oily breakfast he started eating chips . Then got sleep which was just at random time <br /><br />

                    When woke up again eat (while watching reels) <br /><br /> And while day he was just saying everyone that please do this , please do that <br /><br /> Further he went sleep <br /><br />

                    But around 12 am when he felt everyone is asleep , he went to roof top and started crying , punching the walls , and saying, " why God , why " <br /><br /> Repeating this all , and just crying <br /><br />

                    Further we saw , Ursh was watching this all from behind and also had tears in his eyes <br /><br /> When K was coming back to stairs , Ursh quickly moved down stairs . <br /><br />

                    When Ursh had seen K sleeping , he went to statue of God his their house and started complaining to God ,, saying, " why God , what K bad has done in his life , why he is suffering from this pain , one day mr. Perfect and another day mr. Imperfect . And then at that night regrets that day , cause he wanted to save the day , but totally waste it , please God do something <br /> I can't see him in this condition anymore " <br /><br />

                    With this , Ursh went to sleep with tears in his eyes <br /><br />

                    Next morning K woke up early , did meditation , then moved out of house for his meetings and so regular day passed <br /><br />

                    Now some more days had passed with same routine <br /><br /> So after some days it was going a regular perfect day , he was in his research lab from morning 9 am . <br /><br /> Moving here and there , ordering Steve and finally at evening 6 pm (he didn't ate anything till now) <br /><br /> He published his thesis <br /><br />

                    The summary of his thesis was as such <br /><br /> As we know our universe is made of Matter and there are some theories that there are universes that are made of antimatter but he told that as we know there are empty spaces between atoms ,, so according to him these empty spaces are anti matter means that <br /><br /> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br /><br /> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br /><br /> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br /><br /> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br /><br /> Suppose this is a body made of Matter,, <br /> Circles are atoms <br /> So if we remove circles and highlight rest of part , then that is anti matter <br /> And as some theories says if Matter and anti matter collide then there can be blast so according to him there must be a 2d or 3d plate or lining between both of them which would be neutral so named it as 'neutro matter ' inspired from the words neutrons <br /><br />

                    He also added some possibilities that how could we enter in it and what would we see in it <br /><br /> And some small details like once he was halusinating and saw something different while seeing moreover listed some glitches present in universe,, connecting them to his thesis <br /><br />

                    So finally he published it on his website where he also patent his thesis <br /><br /> And finally his thesis was open to the world <br /><br /> He was so much happy and excited after a long time he came out and told his friends and wife that finally he had done his research,, (having smile on his face) <br /><br />

                    He hugged everyone,, Everyone was making a little weird face <br /><br /> But his wife was still smiling but it was like she is holding her tears and said ," great work , let me bring sweets" saying this she went to kitchen with some tears in her eyes <br /><br />

                    When K asked everyone about their weird face <br /> Then Ursh answered in a sad tone ," bro , you forgot, today was her birthday" <br /><br /> K : oh shit , how could I <br /><br />

                    K quickly went to kitchen hugged paki , wished her , sayed sorry again and again <br /><br /> Paki stopped him and said ,"it's ok , if you forgot that today was my birthday,, but you know what from past many days I am just feeling you forget me " <br /><br /> Listening this K moved back <br /><br /> Paki : I don't needed any gift but I really need you , your time <br /><br />

                    K : so sorry , i agree I am wrong but <br /><br />

                    Paki : don't say anything , I know from what you are going through , I am saying this all because you completed your research and I had decided if today also you were like earlier i wouldn't say a single line to you ,, but making you realize that we all ,, your family,, needs you without any need ,, we love you and are Missing you ,, you really need to make balance,, at last from tomorrow if you follow your daily routine i wouldn't have a single complain , i will always stand with you whenever you will need . <br /><br />

                    Saying this she went to room <br /><br />

                    Next day when he woke up he saw many negative comments of his thesis, most were making fun of that , some were blaming him that it is copied and others doing something else ,, only a small percent was supporting him , his years of reputation got broke with this <br /><br />

                    He saw videos where some of his ideal scientists were saying that he is just wrong and impractical without and making fun of him <br /><br /> Some of people from different religion raging at him that if his thesis was true then any sign of that must been given in holy books of their respective religion <br /><br />

                    He started calling many people who he supposed to support him , but no one picked up his call <br /><br /> He locked the room <br /><br />

                    Paki , Ursh , raav and pray were seeing all the responses <br /><br />

                    Further When raav moved to K's room felt that it was locked , he knocked it , started beating shouting to make k open it <br /><br />

                    But K from inside replied,"no" <br /><br />

                    Hearing the noice all came and asked what happened <br /><br /> Raav told them every thing and they started pushing the door , making it break <br /><br />

                    As They entered they saw K sitting on a corner, head down and crying <br /><br />

                    They all moved to him , consoled him , gave water , <br /><br />

                    K : I was doing all of this for improvement in human race but this human race became against me , i lost connections from you all for while world , and this world made me lost from life ,, what wrong i had done <br /><br />

                    They took him to the hall <br /><br />

                    Tried to making him stop crying but again K started crying <br /><br />

                    Further K looking at paki <br /> Said , " i forgot your birthday , still you didn't blamed me ,, please scold me or beat me , i actually deserve this , I am so stupid that for others i forgot you " <br /><br />

                    Ursh(in a loud voice ): no K , you have done nothing wrong, yes you forgot her birthday, but this was just a small mistake, we can't ignore that before this year you made all of us feel so special each day wheather the day was ordinary or special <br /> So if everyone is making fun of you , then it's their fault ,, not yours Please don't blame yourself, i request <br /><br />

                    Rest of 3 also agreed with Ursh <br /><br />

                    K : love you all ,, from now I am totally yours ,, may all other go to hell <br /><br />

                    Interval 1 <br /><br />
                    <br />
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>EMPTY SPACES PART-2</h2>

                <p>
                    <br />

                    So after speaking this ,, all of them went to sleep , so the next K called everyone in hall ,, and spoke <br /><br />

                    Now what should I do ,, if made videos like earlier, I may get views and money but with negative comments only , my whole reputation ruined,, people started picking my smallest mistake,, my smallest wrong words and many manipulated videos are viral on internet,, of course I have a true audience,, which cared , but it's a small number,, coming next , no one will call me for any interview, podcast or any Collab of for any singing show <br /><br />

                    Next is literature part , yes I could do that ,, but they also don't guarantee the money <br /><br />

                    Paki : you need not earn much money we will manage everything <br /><br />

                    Ursh : yes , and as you want to do work , you may write and upload it ,, no need to read comments ,, for YouTube,, upload gaming videos ,, no need to read comments,, we will give you honest review about them <br /><br />

                    Raav : and music is thing you do from heart ,, no need to show it to others <br /><br />

                    K : sounds good ,, let's try this life now , but wait let me meet you with someone <br /><br />

                    Saying this K went to his gaming room ,, came after a little while <br /><br />

                    Whistled and said " hey steve come " <br /><br />

                    Thus,, saying this <br /> Steve the robo appeared in front of everyone <br /><br />

                    K told everyone about him and the things he could do ,, moreover k also said to everyone that don't consider him as a robot but as my friend <br /> He may help you all with your works ,, a little help of him can make your work easier,, but just don't be dependent on him <br /><br />

                    Saying this , K went to his gaming room ,, recorded a video ,, and uploaded <br /><br />

                    Further playing guitar and then continuing his novel <br /><br />

                    Meanwhile others went to their work <br /><br />

                    But Paki and Ursh were facing very high problems ,, as they were close to K so people were not accepting them to work with them <br /><br />

                    The thing happened was that <br /><br />

                    As Ursh was businessman,, he went for a deal , but the party made insult of him and left ,, <br /> Whereas paki, who worked in a research department was fired due to public pressure <br /><br />

                    On other hand raav who was a doctor and has his own hospital,, in his hospital number of patients were less as compared to every day <br /><br /> And those who came and saw him went back <br /><br />

                    So he had to move back to home <br /><br />

                    Coming next to pray who worked as CA in a big company was not being well treated from colleagues <br /><br />

                    When raav came back home ,, so early, K asked the reason but raav told a lie that there was no emergency case , other doctors said that they will manage , so I came back <br /><br />

                    Raav also asked k that was he doing till now <br /><br />

                    K told him about the 3 things he did and further he was surfing internet to know why he is getting so much hate <br /><br />

                    As this much hate can't be just because of a simple hypothesis <br /><br />

                    Raav : so what result did you get <br /><br />

                    K : let everyone come <br /><br />

                    After some time firstly paki and then Ursh came <br /><br />

                    They honestly told what had happened <br /><br /> K was tensed but not in shock <br /><br />

                    K : hmmm , i guess I know the reason but let's wait for pray <br /><br />

                    At evening pray came , he also hide the truth <br /><br />

                    So after pray got refreshed <br /><br /> Everyone gathered in K's room <br /><br />

                    K showed them some videos and articles published <br /><br />

                    The 1st video stated that his thesis is violating some religious sentiments but it was seeming pointless to him as it said that according to some scriptures multiverse exist and they are far away from earth and people need to go out their universe, moreover some ruthless negative debate on the possibilities he gave <br /><br />

                    Next video showed that how arrogant he is and how down he can go <br /><br />

                    As it was shown that some years back once someone made parody video on his friendship which he didn't liked so he made a constructive criticism video on that which didn't spread hate at all but the thing he was unaware was that on some other app , which he didn't knew about, some of his toxic fans started giving hate to the creator who made parody video , and making morphed images of that creator <br /><br />

                    The next video showed that recently he had given few minutes at a random interview at road where he said a positive thing but started it with a sarcasm so in that video only the sarcasm part was shown <br /><br />

                    And number of these videos were just going more and more <br /><br />

                    Coming next to some articles where a total negative life style of K was shown <br /><br /> That how in name of friendship he is just making emotional dramas and also that his love was fake and had done marriage just for his profit and many more his good habits were shown in a bad way <br /><br />

                    After showing these things to everyone <br /><br />

                    K : now something which I can see is that this is totally planned , someone who is powerful wants to downgrade me <br /> But who , why and what did he gain <br /><br />

                    Next the scene we could see was that <br /><br />

                    In a room 7 people were there in which one scientist and one mathematician whom K consider as idle ,, 3rd one was leader of biggest mafia of Asia , 4th one was a business man whom very few people knew about as his income was hidden from the world , 5th one of the politician from Russia and 2 of the remaining whose description was not given were sitting at the front <br /><br />

                    It was being discussed that , their plan to destroy K is going well <br /><br />

                    Then mathematician said that : I was seeing him from a long time , he wasn't stopping, he was telling the truth , the things we couldn't solve were being solved by him <br /><br />

                    Scientist : yes , after listening to his theories , I concluded that they are right <br /><br />

                    Business man : so that's why you both wanted to destroy him so that your respective teams can gave results to public ,, timely <br /><br />

                    Mafia leader : let me handle him , I will kill him the moment you say <br /><br />

                    Politician : he is trapped, and now can't escape <br /><br />

                    Front person 1 : no need to take his life <br /><br />

                    Front person 2 : just destroy him completely <br /><br />

                    Coming back to the home scene of K <br /><br />

                    K : whoever it is , wants me to destroy completely, he will do anything , will not care , and has no limits <br /><br />

                    Paki : then what now <br /><br />

                    K : you all just chill ,, I will handle this , but wait ... <br /><br />

                    After a little conversation everyone get back to their rooms and slept <br /><br />

                    Further came the next day <br /><br />

                    It was going very simple <br /><br /> Everyone is engaged in something or else <br /><br /> And K is cooking food for everyone and listening music <br /><br />

                    Suddenly paki came in very stressed mode <br /><br /> K stopped the music and asked her , what happened <br /><br />

                    Paki : I started reading newspaper , and the first news I saw was that 1 bank got scammed, someone took crores as loan and got out of the country, another bank , the trustees of the bank , taking whole money from bank , got out of the country and another bank got robbed just yesterday and these are the 3 banks in which our mostly money was stored , <br /><br />

                    On your earlier suggestion we put our money in different banks instead of one , as if one faces any issue then we must have some savings <br /><br /> But here all 3 ,, <br /><br />

                    Moreover how the news came collectively <br /> It should have been one by one <br /><br />

                    K : wait wait wait , don't panic , we will definitely get out of the situation <br /><br />

                    Suddenly Ursh appeared <br /><br />

                    Ursh (in surprised tone) : i lost my all business , recently I had a big project which was to be further delivered to public, but when it was delivering, someone burnt everything, my all trucks , <br /><br />

                    I had to pay a large amount, which got away from my bank account, despite public has a large anger on me that I scammed them , i can't understand what just happened. <br /><br />

                    Raav : I have 2 bad news one that my hospital was raided , 2nd place where pray worked suffered a mass firing in which 17 people got died and 7 people are injured <br /><br />

                    Suddenly pray appeared <br /><br />

                    Pray : thanks to you K you advised me to resign in yesterday's end discussion, otherwise <br /><br />

                    Raav : yes , your predictions were so accurate, as you said yesterday night , I sent my some trusted people to my hospital to check everything completely and we got fake equipments and some fake patients with drugs <br /><br /> So in night only we called police and so in morning nothing wrong happend <br /><br />

                    Ursh : but what should I do , despite I have some money left , due to your yesterday's advise I sold all my shares , as my account was blocked today morning by the app owners , but people have a large anger on me <br /><br />

                    K : for now best solution is to sell your company, but don't do it till I say to do , moreover you know more than me , in this field , so you have more chances to get better idea , but please tell it to me <br /><br />

                    Ursh : hmmm , every problem has solution <br /><br />

                    Paki : And what about us , only a month would be survived from the savings in our all other banks , despite we control everything , how would basic expenses be managed . <br /><br />

                    K : do you really think I never thought of this situation,, from the day our money started growing in our banks , <br /> I was saving cash in the basement , despite It is not as much as in our banks , but it is enough for many months , if we will do everything in control. <br /><br /> But first think how could we get out of whole situation , because till now we don't know who is all behind this , and most dangerous thing is that , he knows everything about us . <br /><br />

                    Ursh : Then what should be out priority <br /><br />

                    K : listen all , we have 2 choices <br /> 1st one , keep quite , do nothing, keep hiding, for few months , after that do something normal work and live the life <br /><br /> 2nd one , think something, so that we could get out of this situation, firstly convert public's hate to love again and then everything would get nice <br /><br />

                    Everyone altogether said , "of course, 2nd one" <br /><br />

                    K : so go and think some idea , in your own way <br /><br />

                    With this K went to his room and started playing guitar <br /><br />

                    Ursh went to roof top in cool breeze , sitting and thinking <br /><br />

                    Paki blindfolded herself <br /> And started thinking in different positions, standing on one leg , head stand or something else <br /><br />

                    Raav started meditating <br /><br />

                    And Pray Started lifting dumbbells present in his room <br /><br />

                    After 2 hrs all met , with their idea , <br /><br />

                    Ursh : i guess I must sell the company asap and give the total amount to people <br /><br />

                    Paki : instead take help of media , I have some of my trusted friends in media who would display whatever you want to say , truly <br /><br />

                    Raav : do you have some contacts to whom public would listen <br /><br />

                    Pray : i will just say honesty is the best policy <br /><br />

                    K : firstly I want to gather some proofs of Many things , Paki , call your friends, I will face everyone , Ursh , say your decision in front of everyone and now I will call 2 of my friends , not close as you all , but the level of trust is totally High , <br /><br />

                    Ursh : who <br /><br />

                    K : cheg and vay both are literally awesome, highly successful in their life , cheg one of the best engineers , and vay after doing simple job for some time , didn't stopped , did business , a professional hacker and now has everything he wanted , dreamed off and really deserved , I will call them asap <br /><br />

                    Further K went to his room , took his phone , searched their names in contact and send SOS code to both of them and sent location <br /><br />

                    Within some hours both of them arrived (they didn't knew each other) <br /><br />

                    K went out and took them in , after coming inside K introduced everyone to eachother <br /><br /> Then they asked what happened <br /><br />

                    Raav said to k," didn't you told what had happened" <br /><br />

                    K : I only sent an SOS code according to which genuine it's a need and you need to come <br /><br />

                    Raav : oh damn ,, nice <br /><br />

                    Cheg : so tell what happened <br /><br />

                    K : not here , come to the roof <br /><br />

                    All 3 went to the the roof <br /><br />

                    Then K told both of them the whole story <br /><br />

                    After completing, k hugged both of them and said , " thanks for coming , only on a single SOS code without even knowing the matter" <br /><br />

                    Vay : no need bro , please don't do the formalities , just tell what can we do for you , despite sitting beside you in the conference <br /><br />

                    K : you know what allegations are on me , find way with help of your skills to disprove them <br /><br />

                    Cheg : ok , give us time , we would find some way out <br /><br />

                    K : you can take the laptop if needed <br /><br />

                    Vay : I have mine <br /><br />

                    Cheg : I forgot to carry, yes give it please <br /><br />

                    So after the discussion all went down and started doing the things they could do <br /><br />

                    One room was given to both of them , meanwhile others were to do their respective works , <br /><br /> Like K had planned to gather some more proofs of his thesis , he was also working on that , <br /><br />

                    Now it was night , cheg and vay came out , while others were on sofa , discussion something, then said, " we have a very interesting presentation for you all guys , if K gave this is the conference he would definitely get out of public anger , then both of them showed their work to them <br /><br />

                    K : really impressive , the things I couldn't found out , you did so easily <br /><br />

                    Cheg : main role is of vay , as he knew hacking , he found out your real videos , and some names which I will tell you further but the names would be within we 3 , till the conference <br /><br />

                    K : alright <br /><br />

                    Raav : but why <br /><br />

                    K : no questions , please bro , if he is saying that then their must be a valid reason <br /><br />

                    Pray : I want to ask something , don't mind , neither take it otherwise, but if cheg and vay did the things without coming here , everything would be discussed online , then it would have saven a lot time , and their efforts, please don't take me wrong, I am happy , they came , you met but <br /><br />

                    Cheg : no need to clarify your question , you are absolutely right but <br /><br />

                    K : yeah , but what If the talk we do is being tapped , our enemy would know our plan , moreover <br /><br />

                    Vay : it was was for our security purpose also , we are helping him so .. <br /><br />

                    Pray: ok i understand, good decision <br /><br />

                    K : so a day after tomorrow we could have the conference <br /><br />

                    Paki : we could do it Tommorow only , i want to get out of this , asap <br /><br />

                    K : I know , but a little work is to be done , please , <br /><br />

                    Paki : okk , fine <br /><br />

                    So the next day came <br /><br />

                    In the morning K was busy in the basement , after some hours he came and said to all , " I am ready , let me fix the conference for tomorrow , but where is Ursh " <br /><br />

                    Paki : you didn't told that you were in basement , <br /><br />

                    K : i guessed , you would have understood that if I am not in house then must be in my place, why didn't you called me <br /><br />

                    Paki (little nervous): few hours back a call came to Ursh , we didn't listened it , but he told that you are calling him somewhere, so he went. <br /><br /> Despite we said that any of us can come with him , but he told that you had callen him specially <br /><br />

                    K : oh noooo , this is a trap , I need to go , Vay find Ursh's location, give it to me and paki , set Tomorrow's conference, I will come with him by Tommorow , I am leaving <br /><br />

                    So k went , it was night , but no one came , <br /><br />

                    Suddenly Ursh came , everyone asked him about k , he was shocked , and said , " I don't know , what happened" <br /><br />

                    Paki : first, you tell where were you , as we know K didn't called you <br /><br />

                    Ursh : yes , it was a trap, actually the thing happened was that , a call came someone said that they have kidnapped K , they even showed his voice , still when I wasn't sure they did video call where k was with them in chains, still I did a call on K's phone, it was dead , then they said me to come at their location alone , so I went , lying to you all <br /><br />

                    Then paki told him everything happened after he left <br /><br />

                    Ursh : yes , When I went the location was again and again Changing, even my phone became dead , after some hours i came to realise the enemy ' s plan and so came back in hurry, but it was cause of me , k is missing <br /><br />
                    Paki : please don't blame yourself, I am worried , had something bad happened to him , no no no , i shouldn't even think so <br /><br />

                    Ursh : yes please don't , i know k would be fine , he can't be trapped , he would have knew enemy's plan , and would come soon <br /><br />

                    Paki : I hope so <br /><br />

                    Ursh : what about the conference <br /><br />

                    Paki : I fixed it for Tommorow, shall I cancel it <br /><br />

                    Ursh : no , if k said he would come then he would definitely come <br /><br />

                    No one slept next night , everyone was waiting for K <br /><br />

                    From night to morning, then to conference time , K didn't came , <br /><br />

                    Reporter : where is K , we would only talk to him , if he is not present, we don't want to listen any of you <br /><br />

                    Ursh : he will come , he said that , so he would definitely come , please wait . <br /><br />

                    Much time went but K didn't came and reporters went back <br /><br />

                    Everything came to end reputation of K had totally gone <br /><br />

                    But the question still lies where K is ?? <br /><br />

                    INTERVAL -2 <br /><br />
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>EMPTY SPACES PART-3</h2>

                <p>
                    <br />


                    So K was missing<br /><br />

                    When reporters went away tired of Waiting , rest all in stress , sadness and worry came back<br /><br />

                    Ursh(shouting ): what should we do , who so ever has done this , I will not leave him<br />
                    (falling on knees , very sad voice) : but what can I do , I don't even know how would I reach him , he tricked me and cause of me K got displaced<br /><br />

                    Paki ( in heavy tone) : please, stop blaming yourself, instead focus on how can we find K<br /><br />

                    Ursh (in a little mad/childish voice ) : yes you are right , let's make plan , I will do anything to find him .<br /><br />

                    Vay : i can track location of his phone , but would be that enough<br /><br />

                    Paki : but the location may be of last when the phone was on , it is dead now<br /><br />

                    Vay : I can even find location of his dead phone , but it may take a while<br /><br />

                    Paki : ok then please do asap ,<br /><br />

                    Raav : listen ,, I have a small plan if enemies would be near him then , after tracing his location , reach there , half of us will distract the enemy and rest will save K , paki you , Ursh and cheg you 3 will save K , rest all of us will distract them<br /><br />

                    Paki : yes alright<br /><br />

                    After 15-20 minutes vay came and said , " i have traced ,, let's go"<br /><br />

                    Everyone in a hurry went to the location,, on reaching, they found that it was a small house , on entering , they found it totally dark<br /><br />

                    They on their flash lights , suddenly saw a room where a little light was already there ,<br /><br />

                    Ok entering the room they found a hold on roof , it was sunlight and just beneath was a chair<br /><br />

                    So they put their flashlights near the chair and everyone got shocked<br /><br />

                    A phone and a smart watch was lying near the chair ,, it was of K<br /><br />

                    Everyone was in shock , if belongings of k are there then where is K<br /><br />

                    Ursh : how , agreed that phone can be thrown easily but how the watch , it is only possible if K is unconscious or ..<br /><br />

                    Paki(shouting in sad tone)  : noooo , nothing can happen to him , he promised me<br /><br />

                    Ursh : wait what , you didn't tell that he promised , tell what happened<br /><br />

                    Paki : when K was going to leave to find you , I forced him that I will also come , but he refused so I asked him a promise that whether he couldn't come the next day but he must return<br />
                    But ...<br /><br />

                    Ursh : but what<br /><br />

                    Paki : the promise K gave was , " ok ok I promise that I will try my best to come Tommorow only , but despite due to issues , i will surely come back if I am in this world "<br /><br />

                    Ursh : what do you mean  , I know he is alive , he can't die because I am alive ,<br /><br />

                    Then Ursh was almost going to cry , a tear also came but quickly he wiped it<br /><br />

                    After the discussion they again started putting flashlights in the room and other rooms ,, but the only weird thing they found was that there were too many plugs in the room<br /><br />

                    So as they couldn't find any clue so came back to home , all tensed and sad<br /><br />

                    Next coming to scene of K ,, he was sitting unconscious on the chair in the dark room .<br /><br />

                    After a minute or 2 he woke up<br /><br />

                    Coming back to full senses he lifted himself and went outside<br /><br />

                    But was feeling extra pressure on his every part of body<br /><br />

                    Though He quickly went to his house<br /><br />

                    On going he feeling something weird his happening,, but instead of giving attention to anything else he rushed to his house ,, opened the gates  and door ,, but before entering in hall , he stopped as he could listen some discussion was going on,, which was not clear ,, so firstly he peeped into the hall , and was shocked as someone who looked like him, even the clothes were same  was sitting with everyone , K had no clue , so he went to the hall shouting to his look a like , "who are you , what are you doing here ", then pointing towards others ," how could you all not recognize me , I am your real K ,, not him "<br /><br />

                    Then Ursh interrupted in between and said , " no you are not , he is real one , you must be enemies weapon"<br /><br />

                    Paki : yes I also think so , just go away , what do you want from us<br /><br />

                    K was confused why anyone is not recognising him ,, moreover feeling bad<br /><br />

                    But Then k already present there said, " wait everyone, if he is enemy , how did he entered, passing the password, biometric and the puzzles "<br /><br />

                    Original K : because I know everything, I am real one<br /><br />

                    Paki : let's come outside And check one by one , who is real one,but firstly one of you wear a hat , so that we could recognise who came earlier and who now<br />
                    Further original K wore it<br /><br />

                    Everyone went outside , firstly original K passed the biometric and then the K present there passed it<br /><br />

                    Now everyone was confused, what the hell is happening<br /><br />

                    Everyone was discussing , that who could be real and who not<br /><br />

                    After a few moments when K looked at sky he was terribly shocked<br /><br />

                    K : what the hell ,, when I came to sense it was late afternoon, but now it's morning , how , what the hell<br /><br />

                    Everyone was looking him with a weird expression,<br /><br />

                    Ursh : so what , what is new in this or to being surprised<br /><br />

                    Original K : but it's firstly morning then afternoon then evening and then night<br /><br />

                    Already present K : wait , no no no what are you talking about<br /><br />

                    Further others started discussing about what k was speaking about<br /><br />

                    But for a moment both the K were silent<br /><br />

                    And after some moments both of them togetherly said ,<br /><br />

                    " MULTIVERSE "<br /><br />

                    Coming to scene where original paki , Ursh and others were present, discussion about where K could be and how could they find him<br /><br />

                    Ursh : what should we do now , I mean from where could we start , our first clue was of no use<br /><br />

                    Raav : may be we should go back to the dark room , only from there we would be able to find next hint<br /><br />

                    Pray : we can see foot prints through uv light<br /><br />

                    Raav : but it would contain or foot prints<br /><br />

                    Pray : yes , but not only ours ,, we would recognise which are ours and which not , we could find where everyone went<br /><br />

                    Cheg : no use ,, I have already done that while we were there no other foot prints were present<br /><br />

                    Ursh : wait ,, till now I was thinking enemies left in a hurry, as they left K's items there only , but they had time , cleaned the floor , which means<br /><br />

                    Paki : which means phone and watch were left intentionally and may contain some hint<br /><br />

                    So paki brought the phone and the watch<br /><br />

                    The watch was normal and nothing different was in it<br /><br />

                    But when they switched on the phone and started Opening different applications and Opened ' notes '<br /><br />

                    A file named ' mystery of K ' was there<br /><br />

                    And when they opened it ,, it was written,<br />
                    "HE REACHED TO HIS THESIS "<br /><br />

                    They all were shocked , they knew , the enemy had wrote it but were confused as according to thesis of K , Empty spaces exist and something like that<br /><br />

                    So after thinking this they were confused that did K reached the empty spaces, but what that meant<br /><br />

                    Suddenly vay got something<br /><br />

                    Vay : wait have we opened the watch and the phone<br /><br />

                    Ursh : no , and this phone can't be opened and if done then nothing could be put in it<br /><br />

                    Paki : and what about watch , we should fastly open it<br /><br />

                    Cheg : I will do it<br /><br />

                    So after 10-12 minutes cheg finally opened the watch and found a chip in it<br /><br />

                    The chip could be fit in K's phone<br /><br />

                    And when they plug it something started downloading in the phone ,, it was a video ,,<br /><br />

                    The video started<br /><br />

                    There were 2 guys with a full face mask one black and other white<br /><br />

                    The rest all was dark<br /><br />

                    They started speaking<br /><br />

                    Guy 1 : So , you found the chip , and now want to know where k had gone<br /><br />

                    Guy 2 : should we tell you , oh you may have known till now<br /><br />

                    Guy 1: yeah , his is in his thesis<br /><br />

                    Guy 2 : no bro , he is with them only , but can't be seen cause he is in empty spaces<br /><br />

                    Guy 1 : honesty speaking, we don't know but the thing you should know is K was right , but no one believed him<br /><br />

                    Guy 2 : so , now what are you thinking, showing this video to police, nah you can't and without any proof none would believe you<br /><br />

                    Both guys together: don't even try to catch us , we are beyond your capacity<br /><br />

                    With that the video ended<br /><br />

                    Ursh : now I have understood everything<br /><br />

                    Paki : what<br /><br />

                    Ursh : cause I had read his thesis in detail so I can tell that he is in this universe only but the universe has atoms shaped like stars like the empty spaces between 4 atoms<br /><br />
                    ⭕⭕<br />
                    ⭕⭕<br /><br />

                    Like they have in between<br /><br />

                    And he is present in that universe<br /><br />

                    (In a very depressed tone)<br /><br />

                    But I can't tell how could he be back<br /><br />

                    Either we or him have to do something<br /><br />

                    But what<br /><br />

                    Coming back to K's scene<br /><br />

                    From now we would call our original K as K<br /><br />

                    And the other K as K'<br /><br />

                    So<br /><br />

                    K' (to his team ) : i guess you all should get inside, only me and him will talk and yes it's very serious so please<br /><br />

                    K : I think I should leave and not met any person here<br /><br />

                    K' : wait , you don't know anything about us , you would need people, and the only person you must talk to is me else something bad in time could happen<br /><br />

                    K : ok ok I can understand what you want to say<br /><br />

                    Then all others except these 2 go inside and both of them go to a place where no one could disturb there talk<br /><br />

                    A place which was all covered with trees and in between a waterfall<br /><br />

                    Both earlier used to came Many a times to make themselves relief<br /><br />

                    So the discussion started<br /><br />

                    K : I can't believe multiverse really exist, I mean I knew about this theory but it's unbelievable that it's real<br /><br />

                    K' : yeah me too , but one thing don't touch me by mistakely as any disruption could happen<br /><br />

                    K : yeah I know that , but really it's difficult to realise that someone with same protons neutrons , living the same birth to death , how is it<br /><br />

                    K' : wait wait wait , what the ,, I mean what did you said<br /><br />

                    K : what happened, I just said normal things<br /><br />

                    K' : we are not made of protons , neutrons,, we are made of anti protons and anti neutron in short anti matter and yes we live from death to birth<br /><br />

                    K : what , really but how ,, wait wait wait i some like felt that you could be made of antimatter but this death to birth is new for me<br /><br />

                    K' : that means matter really exist from which you all are made of , and how can someone live from birth to death<br /><br />

                    K : we take birth from mother's worm and our death death can be very certain Many types Many ways and yes we are babies as we born and grow further ,, what about you<br /><br />

                    K' : we die , I mean start our life in numerous ways it can be an accident, or poison or burning or inside a pit<br />
                    And so we know our age and how Many years we would live and then starts decreasing our age and height till zero and at end we end up in mother's worm and then what happens don't know may be we get converted to sperm or may be , not sure<br /><br />

                    K : damn , that's confusing , but I somewhat understood the summary,, but yes we both will not tell each other what had happened till now in our lives<br /><br />

                    K ' : yeah ,  but I am understanding everything , something really wrong had happened<br /><br />

                    K : yeah I must not have come here<br /><br />

                    K' : no not that , but if by any means you have to come to this universe you must have gone to a different time<br /><br />

                    K: means<br /><br />

                    K' : let me take an example<br /><br />

                    123<br />
                    1'2'3'<br /><br />

                    Take these as 2 timelines one belong to you and other me<br /><br />

                    Let these 3 numbers be middle of our age and you were present at 1 then you must come at 3'<br /><br />

                    Not at 1'<br /><br />

                    Let taking example our age is 100 , not really,, I will not tell the exact,, this is just an example<br /><br />

                    So you are 30 so you must have gone to time when I was 70<br /><br />

                    But I am too 30<br /><br />

                    This is really wrong<br /><br />

                    K : okays I am understanding it to a level<br /><br />

                    It means if my total age would be 100 then you have lived 70 years of life<br /><br />

                    K' : yeah , and that's why I have more knowledge that you<br /><br />

                    K : one question, in start we don't have knowledge,, which we gain as we grow what about you<br /><br />

                    K' : same , we also don't have any knowledge and we gain it as we get small<br /><br />

                    K : oh , at least something is constant in both the universes , it's really difficult to understand<br /><br />

                    K' : hmmm , little for me too but what next how could you go back , thought something?<br /><br />

                    K : not till now but let's meditate so that we could get any idea<br /><br />

                    After that both of them started meditating<br /><br />

                    Coming back to original world<br /><br />

                    They decided that any how they have to find enemy's location<br /><br />

                    Ursh : I have a plan<br /><br />

                    Then he told the plan to everyone<br /><br />

                    Next thing they did was that<br /><br />

                    Ursh and paki sitting together made a video which was as such<br /><br />

                    Paki and Ursh : hello everyone<br /><br />

                    Ursh : we know you all are very upset from us and mainly K<br /><br />

                    Paki: but once there was a time you loved him<br /><br />

                    Ursh : we are not here to give any explanation or his justification<br /><br />

                    Paki: but to give you an info , it's your choice to believe it or not that<br /><br />

                    Ursh and paki: K is missing<br /><br />

                    Ursh : We don't know where he is or gone but the only thing we know is that he is not gone intentionally, someone has trapped him somewhere<br /><br />

                    Paki : may be you would think that this is just a stunt to play with your emotions and after sometime when everyone would be emotional we would say K is back<br /><br />

                    Ursh : i really wish him to come back and yes it's quite possible that he could come back anytime but at present he is Missing and it's totally upto you to believe us or not<br /><br />

                    Paki: we would not say to forgive him but please pray for him<br /><br />

                    With that the video ended<br /><br />

                    Ursh : i know what this video can do ,,<br /><br />

                    The video spreaded very fast and reached millions of views along with those 7 persons<br /><br />

                    Coming to the room where 7 people were seeing the video<br /><br />

                    Mafia : you had explained them so well but still they didn't understood what we are , give me a chance I will make all of them disappear from this world<br /><br />

                    Politician: yes and I would erase all their details from everywhere<br /><br />

                    Head 1 : no , now we would handle this ourselves<br /><br />

                    Head 2 : yeah , now no one can save them from us<br /><br />

                    Coming to Ursh's scene<br /><br />

                    Ursh : according to me the video must have reached out enemies and they would definitely reach us ,, either to finish us ,, but this time I wouldn't be trapped<br /><br />

                    Paki : so what's the plan further<br /><br />

                    Coming to villain scene<br /><br />

                    Mathematician: so what's your plan<br /><br />

                    So the next scene was as such<br /><br />

                    A person full covered in black suit is spying on their house<br /><br />

                    Whereas in villain area<br /><br />

                    Head 2 : we have trained a person, our spy<br /><br />

                    Head 1 : he has max skills possible, good in hiding or escaping, good in pvp a perfect assassin  to enter their house and<br /><br />

                    Coming back to house scene where the assassin was ready to enter the house ,<br /><br />

                    he firstly waited for night then put night goggles to see clear then go near the gates and put a paper on the area where thumb was required the gates opened, then he had to answer the questions but he then tried to hack the machine to enter the house ,, he was successful and the gates got opened<br /><br />

                    But as the gates opened he fell down gone to a secret basement in which he was trapped in a glass cell . Due to panic he mistakenly touche the glass and so got a high current and got unconscious when woke up found himself tied on a chair and in front Ursh , paki and vay were standing<br /><br />

                    Showing Ursh's plan<br /><br />

                    Actually vay changes some settings of the lock as such now it could be easily hacked but if hacked then would open this passage<br /><br />

                    And k had already made this opening for such Crisis which only Ursh knew about<br /><br />

                    Coming back to present<br /><br />

                    Ursh : who are you and where is K<br /><br />

                    Assasin : i don't know anything, my job was just to enter your house and spread a poisonous gas trough a ball , please let me go<br /><br />

                    Paki: no , say the truth , we were finding you for so long , because of you we are facing this crisis we wouldn't leave you<br /><br />

                    Assasin : you are mistaken , I am just a pawn , your enemies are those 7 , no no no nothing, if you want you can kill me , I will tell you nothing<br /><br />

                    Ursh : you would take us to them<br /><br />

                    Assasin : no please no they would rope me of<br />
                    I beg you to leave me<br /><br />

                    Paki : ok you can go but tell them to send someone clever ,, not like you dumb<br /><br />

                    Ursh : wait what , how could you do that , i have trapped him with so much effort,,why<br /><br />

                    Paki : but he is of no use , and if he helped us he would be in danger along us<br /><br />

                    Ursh : ok fine but I don't think it's right but as you say<br /><br />

                    Then they opened his ropes<br /><br />

                    He stood up ,  thanked to paki and asked the way to leave<br /><br />

                    Then paki covered his eyes and said him to follow as instructed<br /><br />

                    Then somehow they brought him up , a little away from the house , still eyes closed<br /><br />

                    Then said to remove the bindings<br /><br />

                    When he opened his eyes<br /><br />

                    Paki : now leave asap<br /><br />

                    Assasin : thank you again<br /><br />

                    And saying this he flewed away<br /><br />

                    Ursh : good plan paki , now we should chase him<br /><br />

                    They had put tracker on the assassin and now were chasing him from car<br /><br />

                    Ursh : even if he removed the tracker , we would follow him and go to the place<br /><br />

                    Coming to anti world<br /><br />

                    Where K and K' were meditating<br /><br />

                    After some time both stopped meditating<br /><br />

                    K' : no good idea I got , but the thing I can say is the place or the people due to which you came here , they would be source by which you could go back<br /><br />

                    K : hmmm , the  thing I remember is there were 2 masked men in front of me , threatening me , but wait if I try to count<br /><br />

                    1..2..3..<br /><br />

                    Yes there were 7 different voices i could hear , not sure if there were more people or not<br /><br />

                    K' : damn , i guess I know whom you are talking about, i already met them and know their location<br /><br />

                    Let's move<br /><br />

                    Then both of them started moving to enemy's place<br /><br />

                    In real world<br /><br />

                    Paki and Ursh were following the assassin with help of tracker<br /><br />
                    After some time passing through a small forest finally they reached a house<br /><br />

                    Firstly the assassin entered, the weird thing was that it had not any lock<br /><br />

                    After assassin paki and Ursh also entered<br /><br />

                    Assassin then entered a room<br /><br />

                    From door both were seeing him<br /><br />

                    He put something on a stool type thing<br /><br />

                    Further a lever appeared , he pulled that lever and secret basement entry opened then he took the thing back and went quickly to the basement and within few minutes everything was same as before<br /><br />

                    Further paki and Ursh did the same thing and entered the basement<br /><br />

                    It was very much dark<br /><br />

                    Somehow they were moving and then heard something, on following the voice they saw the assassin talking to 2 persons wearing  mask<br /><br />

                    Assassin: sorry sir , i couldn't succeed , they trapped me and said that you must send someone better but they don't know your plan (laughs)<br /><br />

                    Paki and Ursh on surprise when looked back<br /><br />

                    4 guards with gun were there , they were trapped<br /><br />

                    Both of them were taken to front<br /><br />

                    Assassin: did you really thought that i would be so easily to trap me and reach the boss<br /><br />

                    Ursh : we are in front of your main boss and you are saying the thing<br /><br />

                    Then both of the bosses come forward and removed the mask<br /><br />

                    Then we came to know that they were the mathematician and the scientist<br /><br />

                    Mathematician: we are not the main , you can't even touch the shadow of our head , and your game is over now<br /><br />

                    Coming to K and K' scene in car<br /><br />

                    While K was thinking something<br /><br />

                    K' : are you thinking something, why looking so sad<br /><br />

                    K: I was just remembering my team , I am really missing them a lot and what if our plan didn't work , what if I got trap here for forever or what I couldn't reach back<br /><br />

                    K' : ok ok but listen , if timelines have to work properly then you must reach back , earlier i thought I would not tell you but the moment you were being sent here at that moment here too the machine was on , I was also trappes , but due to this disturbance in timeline , I got back near  to my house and you reached here<br />
                    So I guess you would definitely able to go back<br /><br />

                    After some time , both crossing the forest reached the same house<br /><br />

                    K' knew what to do and how to enter and so they entered the basement<br /><br />

                    They both saw the mathematician and the scientist<br /><br />

                    K' : they are not the main leaders but , 2 among those 7 and yes we need to find the machine, and so a plan is needed as their guards are everywhere<br /><br />

                    K: I have a plan I guess<br /><br />

                    Then One of them came in front of the 2 men<br /><br />

                    Mathematician: you are back , this time we will not leave you<br /><br />

                    Then " yes , I came back , to defeat both of you"<br /><br />

                    They called the guards<br /><br />

                    Now he was covered with guards on all sides<br /><br />

                    And they started attacking him but he dodged again and again somehow he was not being touched as if the universe was protecting him from the touch<br /><br />

                    Scientist: wait now I will come<br /><br />

                    All the guards got a side scientist with some weird item  in his hand attacked directly at chest<br /><br />

                    He thought he would dodge but the couldn't and was thrown many inches away<br /><br />

                    But suddenly everyone saw he is back<br /><br />

                    Now we all came to know earlier whom was dodging was K not K'<br /><br />

                    That's why he was able to dodge<br /><br />

                    When scientist saw him he said , " no no no this can't happen"<br /><br />

                    He was very much frightened as if he knew something others not<br /><br />

                    Then he threw a smoke bomb and everyone get flewed away<br /><br />

                    K on standing came near K'<br /><br />

                    K' : are you all right<br /><br />

                    K: yes now but I felt something tearing my chest entered my body but there is not mark as if nothing happened, moreover now it's not paining a bit , so leave it , please tell whether you found the machine<br /><br />

                    K' : yes<br /><br />

                    Both of them get outside K' showed the machine which he put inside the car and then came back<br /><br />

                    Meanwhile in real world<br /><br />

                    Ursh started laughing and whistled then every guard got unconscious only the scientist and mathematician were left<br /><br />

                    Ursh : we knew your plan because of overacting of assassin we were totally Ready and with one more whistle , Raav , Pray , Cheg and Vay appeared<br /><br />

                    Scientist whispered to mathematician: according to orders if something happens like this we quickly have to flew away<br /><br />

                    And with this he threw a smoke bomb<br /><br />

                    And flew away<br /><br />

                    Actually full team of K was there who firstly found the machine , kept it safe and then make everyone unconscious<br /><br />

                    All came outside<br /><br />

                    Set up the machine which needed lot of batteries to get switched on which they took from the basement<br /><br />

                    Ursh: now what should we do ,<br /><br />

                    Paki: i guess if we switched on , then K must come back<br /><br />

                    Ursh : I hope , this is true but if K don't come within some minutes i would enter it<br /><br />

                    Meanwhile there<br /><br />

                    K and K' also set up the machine but with a chair on which K sat<br /><br />

                    K: brother, I will really miss you , it was actually a beautiful time spent with you , thanks<br /><br />

                    K' : we are same but still thanks to you too , i really enjoyed the time with you , someone like me , was just amazing<br /><br />

                    Then both of them had a tear in their eyes but no one cried both had smile on their faces then were going to do a high fi but Stopped<br /><br />

                    Then in real world Ursh and here K' switched on the machine and a great flash appeared<br /><br />

                    When it stopped<br /><br />

                    In real world K saw himself a little up in air<br /><br />

                    Landed one one knee<br /><br />

                    When made his face up<br />
                    Saw his team<br /><br />

                    Everyone was very happy on seeing him<br /><br />

                    Ursh quickly went and lifted K up his happiness on coming down K stretching his arms said<br />
                    Yes guys<br /><br />


                    I AM BACK<br /><br />
                    Interval 3

                    <br /><br />
                </p>
                <h2 className='text-center font-bold'>EMPTY SPACES PART-4</h2>
                <p>
                                       

                   

                    <br />

                So at last we saw K was back in his universe<br /><br />

                As they were in the forest area so quickly went back to their home<br /><br />

                Everyone was so much happy and while they were going everyone was asking him again and again, what happened ame how but K only said let's reach home then I will surely tell everything in detail<br /><br />

                After some time they reached home<br /><br />

                Firstly they gave K some water and then all of them together ate dinner<br /><br />

                Then K took all of them in his room, K was in mid and all others were around him<br /><br />

                K: firstly tell how much do you know, actually my brain is little tired as it has seen very much and is still amazed whether it was real or just a dream<br /><br />

                Paki: you went to find Ursh and then you were just missing<br /><br />

                K: oh yes, I got remember, so when I went to find him, he was again and again changing his location, moving from one place to other very quickly, as through when I stopped for a while and understood that it's a trap for me and not for him, despite I wasn't sure, meanwhile I was analysing everything someone attacked me from back on my head, and when I opened my eyes I was tied with a chair and a machine was fit on me which was being provided with a lot of electricity at the same time<br /><br />

                Ursh: oh that's why there were too many plugs in that room<br /><br />

                Vay: then how could we easily switched on the machine<br /><br />

                K: you too have done that?<br /><br />

                Paki: yes, I will tell everything happened here but firstly complete your side<br /><br />

                K: Vay, may be because it was already more or around 50 percent charged, despite not sure, anyways being tied on chair, I saw 2 persons with mask talking to me saying like I have done wrong, beware, as such, I don't completely remember as at that time I was focusing on a plan to get out, moreover I could hear 5 more different voices in background, as soon as I got the plan to escape with help of wires plugged in, they switched on the machine, as if they knew exactly what I was thinking and in how much time<br /><br />

                Further K told everything happened there and tried to explain the concept of that universe, everyone was speechless as they only assumed, what K had written in his thesis but many things were new to them,<br /><br />

                Anyhow they went back to their rooms so that K could take rest and they too<br /><br />

                Further Paki told everything happened here in his absence<br /><br />

                K: wow, I am proud of you all, you all managed everything very nicely, really, it was<br /><br />

                Paki: K, I completed my promise, what you said, now please can I cry.<br /><br />

                K tightly hugged Paki<br /><br />

                Further coming to next morning<br /><br />

                While Everyone came in Hall<br /><br />

                K: Paki told me everything, I am really proud of you all, you all are really amazing, but<br /><br />

                Ursh: but?<br /><br />

                K: what's next, as you made a video that I was missing, how would you explain everything, and if told the truth, I guarantee none would believe it<br /><br />

                Vay: thanks me I guess<br /><br />

                Paki: wait what, why<br /><br />

                Vay: when Ursh told everything about the universe, I was damn sure that K would return soon, but still that video was important so I did something manipulative<br /><br />

                K: don't say you fooled my audience<br /><br />

                Vay: no no no, I guess, firstly listen then decide that was I right or wrong<br /><br />

                So after some hours of publishing that video, I created a fake account, posted a video as a viewer you and blamed myself as a viewer and your audience that they are responsible for your situation, like said a line, "Cause of us he is gone"<br /><br />

                Moreover from my secret techniques and sources of Paki I made that video popular such that none can know that we had made it popular<br /><br />

                Paki: oh that's why you asked that question at that time, sorry I was accusing you<br /><br />

                Vay: no need, but listen<br /><br />

                Further from my main account I posted some comments like we are really missing you and also saying to the audience that they shouldn't blame themselves in such a way that I never ever seen that video, moreover I also posted posts like we got a plan, there are chances that we could bring you back, not high number but in decent amount<br /><br />

                K (shock): wow bro, you are a true manipulator, I guess now my audience would be little emotional<br /><br />

                Vay: yes<br /><br />

                Ursh: I guess you should tell the truth to your audience<br /><br />

                K: I told, that none would believe it<br /><br />

                Ursh: I am saying about what Vay has done<br /><br />

                K: hmmm, that's really important decision as I could totally backfire on me, as if I told that they were being manipulated then many of them could think that manipulation is still going on and this was all my plan,<br /><br />

                Paki: yes, it's better not to tell the truth<br /><br />

                Ursh: but at least to a live stream, giving all the answers, you had to give in the interview<br /><br />

                K: yeah, I was thinking the same<br /><br />

                Further K posted on his channel that he could be live next day at 11 am, and a poll which asked, should he explain everything or not<br /><br />

                And till 9 pm around 90 percent were yes so he decided to go live<br /><br />

                So after some preparation K came live at 11<br /><br />

                Set up was as such K was sitting on sofa and camera was in front capturing only him rest of the team were side<br /><br />

                So in start of live he greeted everyone and then told that his friends were right and earlier he was trapped somewhere by someone and got out with very much difficulty<br /><br />

                Coming next, he cleared every aspect of his thesis, at every point what he wanted to say, further took camera near his computer, doing a set up, on one screen he was being shown and on other, it was the computer, K played all the videos one by one which were made against him and he gave answer and explanations to all of them.<br /><br />

                Like the first video which said that he was violating religion, he cleared that thing by showing some text in some of ancient manuscripts which portrayed multiverse in same manner like he did,<br /><br />

                Next video which showed him arrogant due to his constructive criticism which spread hate on another platform, he firstly showed the reality of that platform that how toxic and unethical that platform is by various proofs, then once again explained everyone what constructive criticism is moreover at that time he wasn't enough mature to handle jokes on his friendship, which he learnt by time, and also blamed some toxic people who made morphed images of the creator he opposed, moreover on live he called the creator and asked for sorry, as earlier he didn't know about that app.<br /><br />

                Next video which showed his one of edited interview in manipulative manner, he called Vay and said to his audience that Vay with his skills and hard work found the full interview, which then he further played it<br /><br />

                As such 70-80 videos were there and he answered all despite those which showed the same content<br /><br />

                At last he showed articles which commented on his good behavior in a very negative way like friendship and love, showing them he said to the audience that he would never ever give explanations of his love or friendship, saying this was actually very manipulative<br /><br />

                Meanwhile these videos he also gave answers to questions being asked on the live<br /><br />

                Commenting on everything it took around 7 hrs and now it was about to 6 pm<br /><br />

                Further he said that he would further put time stamps of this stream<br /><br />

                Next he asked from everyone to give their support and stop hating him as he cares for them and their interests and tries doing a little emotional aspects<br /><br />

                Further again put a poll asking that should he leave or stay as he is really tired now, which now showed 95 percent yes<br /><br />

                Despite 'come back soon❤' was being spammed in the comment section<br /><br />

                With this he ended the stream<br /><br />

                Ursh: would this be sufficient, as you gave all of them and effort, would they clear your image in their mind<br /><br />

                Paki: not all but mostly I guess<br /><br />

                K: yes, but now my focus is on those 7, earlier I decided to set back, but now I will not spare them, but yes I would need all of you for the final fight, just don't leave me<br /><br />

                Rest all together: yes of course,<br /><br />

                Ursh: it is not the thing to say<br /><br />

                K: actually it's the matter of life and death now, and I can't afford to lose any of you, if anything happened to any of you then, it would be a defeat for me so if any of you think that you can't fight then please go to some safe place for some while, where none can contact you<br /><br />

                Ursh: I promise I would take care of myself and everyone<br /><br />

                Rest all: we too<br /><br />

                Paki: just tell the plan<br /><br />

                K: no, before telling the plan, I will start training of you all, and you have to do that properly<br /><br />

                Pray: what kinda training<br /><br />

                K: training of strength, speed, focus, faith, self-control<br /><br />

                K: come outside in 30 minutes with the best outfit you can do, till I can do the setup<br /><br />

                After 30 minutes all went out where K was in mid, and rest 6 were in front of him<br /><br />

                Then he started martial arts training, punches kicks etc.<br /><br />

                Further said them to punch the walls continually then racing, further meditation with a candle in front where they had to focus<br /><br />

                All of this went continuously for 3 days<br /><br />

                After 3 days<br /><br />

                K: I saw your practice and I guess your basics are prepared well<br /><br />

                Now let's fight, any 2 of you come to fight with me at once, Pray and Raav come<br /><br />

                Both came in front first attack was done by Pray, Pray tried to punch K but K dodged and attacked at his waist and quickly attacked Raav at head with his hand at 90 degrees but from back Pray attacked him which he couldn't dodge but quickly attacked near his knees, making him fall and when Raav tries to attack, K held his hands and made him fall at Pray who was about to stand<br /><br />

                K: go back, Cheg and Vay come<br /><br />

                When they came, both attacked a punch together but K holding both the arms, adding an extra momentum made them hit each other, further made their heads strike making them fall,<br /><br />

                K: go back, Ursh and Paki, come<br /><br />

                Firstly Paki attacked him but instead of attacking him, she just moved sideways, K got confused a little and before he could think further Ursh attacked him with legs at his ankles, making him fall<br /><br />

                K: nice, everyone come and attack<br /><br />

                Now everyone was in front of him<br /><br />

                First Vay started sliding to attack near his feet with his legs but K jumped but suddenly Raav and Pray punched near his face<br /><br />

                But he stopped both the wrists and twisted them further Cheg and Ursh came from back and held his arms, Pray and Raav his legs and Vay his stomach, Paki in front of him, punched him at face<br /><br />

                Then K got an idea<br /><br />

                He used his hip to make Vay away from him and as soon as Vay moved, K started revolving his hips in circular manner, due to which Raav and Pray lost a little grip and the moment K felt that he jumped with the highest force due to which Cheg and Ursh also lost a little grip<br /><br />

                And now it was easy for K to get away as he did back flip and again in situation that he faced all of them in front of him<br /><br />

                K: let's stop, well done, I will tell you the plan now, but please don't stop training<br /><br />

                Further K discussed the plan<br /><br />

                Next day K called a reporter who was trying to approach him<br /><br />

                Despite of normal talk<br /><br />

                K gave hint that there are someone, who are responsible, but can't tell anything else<br /><br />

                Later that evening called another reporter<br /><br />

                And intentionally added 7 in his earlier line but showed it was by mistake<br /><br />

                Next day again called another one where he added that they are very powerful<br /><br />

                And repeats the same thing in the evening<br /><br />

                Till 3 days, he had now given a lot of info<br /><br />

                Which those 7 were also seeing<br /><br />

                Mafia: I think he needs to learn a lesson, just order once, I will rip him off<br /><br />

                Head 1: I guess it's time to meet him, he wants to meet us and want us to give hint<br /><br />

                Back to K and the team<br /><br />

                K: I guess my plan should work, if they are really smart then they would know that I am doing everything to meet them, they after me, me after them, too much fun<br /><br />

                Ursh: it means, he would give hints directly<br /><br />

                Paki: I don't think so, that we could get the directly<br /><br />

                K: yeah, let's rest today and prepare our bags, we would leave tomorrow morning, to the very first house, where I got trapped<br /><br />

                Next morning everyone readied with their bags, clothes in which they were comfort to do anything (running or fighting)<br /><br />

                Sat in the car and went to the old house where K's team found his phone and watch<br /><br />

                After reaching there<br /><br />

                K started analysing the whole house, touching the walls, knocking the walls and even the floor, and putting ear while knocking<br /><br />

                A bit later<br /><br />

                Cheg: we all checked, but we didn't find any secret entrance, I guess we should seek for any other hint<br /><br />

                K: main room where I was tied, is left, let's see<br /><br />

                K again put ears on floor and did a knock<br /><br />

                K: yes, yes, there is a basement<br /><br />

                Cheg: but,,,,,<br /><br />

                Paki: what?<br /><br />

                Cheg: I did the same thing as K did, but I didn't recognize, why,<br /><br />

                K: because there is an extra layer, when I knocked, I knocked at 2 different positions, if I did that at one then it's normal but doing on 2, I heard 2 different voices which showed something is really wrong<br /><br />

                Cheg: ohk<br /><br />

                Pray: should I bring axe or any other tool to dig?<br /><br />

                K: if there is a basement then there must be a code to open<br /><br />

                Ursh: but there is nothing in this room, except these plugs,<br /><br />

                K: yeah, these plugs, something fishy in them, let me think,,<br /><br />

                Someone please bring the wires, I put in the car<br /><br />

                Vay brought the wires (total 10)<br /><br />

                But there were 8 sockets in the room<br /><br />

                K and Ursh plugged all of them, as soon as they plugged the last socket, a low voice of getting something opened came<br /><br />

                But they could see nothing got opened<br /><br />

                But in no time K found out that now the socket could be rotated (as he was still holding the wire's head)<br /><br />

                So K rotated it 360 degrees, but nothing happened<br /><br />

                K said everyone to rotate them slowly and together and also if any sound came then stop immediately, he himself handed 2 of the sockets which were enough near<br /><br />

                So after some while another sound came like something getting dragged and suddenly stopped<br /><br />

                At the very moment the sound came, everyone stopped,<br /><br />

                Nothing was opened but K knew that he was near to the answer<br /><br />

                All others were stopped, while K rotated one of the sockets but nothing happened, brought it to the earlier position, then did the same with the 2nd socket but nothing happened, said all others to do the same thing one by one, but nothing happened in any case<br /><br />

                Then K noticed that Vay, Pray and Cheg were rotating it in the opposite direction and he too was rotating the 2 sockets in different<br /><br />

                Moreover all 4 sockets were in alternative position<br /><br />

                K: I got it, it's based on clockwise and anticlockwise manner alternatively 4 of the sockets are to be rotated in same and other 4 in opposite<br /><br />

                So after assigning everyone, their direction<br /><br />

                They continuously rotated the sockets<br /><br />

                After a while K noticed a sliding gate for the basement being opened as he stopped, the gate got closed with speed<br /><br />

                K: don't stop,<br /><br />

                When the gate opened fully only K stopped, but still the gates got closed rapidly<br /><br />

                As Ursh was near the sliding door so he replaced his position with him<br /><br />

                As soon as the door opened fully K jumped and by an inch K got inside safely, firstly K saw a button, he pressed it, in the room a pressure button appeared, totally in opposite to the basement opening<br /><br />

                It was near Vay, as he pressed it the gates opened, but as moved his hands away they got closed<br /><br />

                Vay: all of you please go to help K, I will stand here<br /><br />

                Ursh: sure<br /><br />

                Vay: yess<br /><br />

                So everyone got inside and told K what happened<br /><br />

                After moving down the stairs a bit they came across a locked door which had 2 rotating handles<br /><br />

                K: that I know very well,<br /><br />

                K opened his bag from that brought a copy out,<br /><br />

                Folding the copy in a cone shape, putting one side near his ear and other on door, he moved the handles and finally a sound came and again a button appeared<br /><br />

                Cheg: now it's my turn to stay<br /><br />

                So Cheg pressed it and the rest went inside<br /><br />

                But again a door came which was connected to a heavy pressure plate <br /><br />

                This time Pray stayed there and finally they reached the main room<br /><br />

                Put light of the torch here and there, saw posters on the wall which were of K and a cross on him then saw a table on which a paper was lying, that was a map<br /><br />

                On the other side on top it was written WELCOME<br /> further, "Why did you leave your friends outside"<br /><br />

                And suddenly the sound of the gate getting closed came<br /><br />

                Further it was written "Follow the map"<br /><br />

                They again started searching more things on walls and then got by a button, pressed it, all the gates opened but none was present there<br /><br />

                K: no no no, what the hell,<br /><br />

                Ursh: don't panic let's quickly move outside they must be there<br /><br />

                Paki: there is a green gas, cover your nose and mouth<br /><br />

                All moved outside the house but no one was there<br /><br />

                Raav: I guess we must follow the map<br /><br />

                K: not we, only me<br /><br />

                Ursh: you can't order any of us,<br /><br />

                Paki: we will come with you<br /><br />

                Raav: let me search clues till you discuss<br /><br />

                K: I can't afford any of you to lose, I already lost my friends, if you got away, then I would<br /><br />

                K falling on knees and joined hands<br /><br />

                K: I beg you, please go<br /><br />

                Paki made him stand,<br /><br />

                Paki: ok, Raav, let's go<br /><br />

                But no response came<br /><br />

                And in no time they recognized, he was also trapped<br /><br />

                Ursh: they are waiting for us to be alone, far from K<br /><br />

                K: ahhhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!<br /><br />

                K: ok let's move, let's see, do or die,<br /><br />

                3 of them sat in the car and followed the map, they further reached near a forest,<br /><br />

                K: I guess, we have to move further by foot<br /><br />

                All started moving inside the forest<br /><br />

                K was a feet ahead of Paki and Ursh but could continuously hear their footsteps and many times did a talk in between<br /><br />

                After moving many miles<br /><br />

                K: I guess we are there, I could see something,<br /><br />

                As he looked back, instead of Paki and Ursh, 2 persons in black were there K punched one of them, the other one held him from back but K hit elbow at his face and easily made both of them unconscious<br /><br />

                Dragging them near to the very big dome situation in the middle of the forest<br /><br />

                K (shouting in an emotional manner): come out cowards, if you have any courage, attack me directly, why my friends<br /><br />

                A gate opened and the pro assassin came out<br /><br />

                Assassin: cool, cool they gave you so many chances to retreat but didn't, it's your fault your friends are captured, ah not only friends but your best friend and also your life, your sweet and hot wife<br /><br />

                K: don't utter a word about them or I will peel off your skin, you will regret<br /><br />

                Assassin: cool, you are not in condition to give any threat, and you know what you still have a choice to go back otherwise come in and get your ass burned by the leaders<br /><br />

                K: just don't harm any of them, I will not leave by any how, let me in and see who's ass gotta burned<br /><br />

                Assassin: yeah none of them would be harmed till you retreat or die so as you have decided so<br /><br />

                'GET READY FOR THE FINAL BATTLE'<br /><br />
