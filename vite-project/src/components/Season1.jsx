                    So in starting we see an interview is going on <br /> With the title ' The knowledge interview ' <br /> Let's we call the person taking interview A <br /> And the person giving it K <br /> So the interview starts <br />

                    A : We welcome you and firstly , how are you? <br /><br /> K : Thanks , I am good and what about you <br /><br /> A : I am also good,, thanks btw for coming,, firstly tell how are you feeling , after reaching so much success in your life <br /><br /> K (little blushes) : thanks for the praise but success is not something it looks like <br /><br /> A : what do you mean <br /><br /> K : I mean one's success can be failure of another and may be success for any 3rd person <br /><br /> A : hmmm, can you tell how <br /><br /> K : I will explain you with an example ,, let 3 persons be A(not you) , B and C <br /> There is a competition <br /> Let A has power to defeat B but will loose from C <br /><br /> And first round is between B and C <br /><br /> Then then success of B is success and A and failure of C whereas <br /> Success success of C is failure of both A and B <br /><br /> A : hmmm nice ,, it means luck plays a major role ,, does it ? <br /><br /> K : yes luck always plays a role but it depends on you hardwork you did <br /><br /> A : how ,, I mean both are correlated,, it's weird to listen <br /><br /> K : yes , but listen how come <br /><br /> So <br /> Take a situation A,B and C <br /> A has done 50% hardwork <br /> Which means A can defeat C <br /> But it depends on luck whether he can fit C or not whereas B and C depends on luck if compete with each other <br /> And if once lost then out of the match <br /> Moreover depends on luck which 2 will first compete together <br /><br /> So if take cases then a total of 4 cases will come and and after adding then you will get probability of 3/4 which means of you have done 50% hardwork then there are 75% chance of your win <br /><br /> So this is how <br /><br /> Whereas if there are 4 persons and A has done 50% hardwork <br /> Which meant he can definitely defeat one of them <br /> Can defeat with probability 3/4 with 2nd of them <br /> And 1/2 probability with 3rd of them <br /><br /> So now there will be 15 cases and on adding them you get probability 75/96 which is around 78% <br /><br /> So now the 3rd case when there are 5 people <br /> You will definitely defeat 2 of them and other 2 depends on luck <br /> Then there will be 64 cases and on adding them you again get 3/4 which means 75 percent <br /><br /> So it's clear that if you have done 50% hardwork then chances of your win is 75%-80% <br /><br /> But remember this is when other players totally depend on luck when played with each other <br /> And when we see the cases in all then you will get to see that it depends on luck that you will win or not <br /><br /> So more hardwork more chance of your win but <br /> Remember luck will have no role of you have done 100% hardwork <br /><br /> A: oh damn , what an explanation, hope are viewers have understood it ,, so tell now do you consider yourself successful or not <br /><br /> K : not completely as I have to do many more <br /><br /> A : what else , you can done while you achieved so much ,, what's your goal then <br /><br /> K : I DON'T KNOW <br /><br /> A : hmmm , so can you tell how you manage all these things together and what should we call you,, <br /> (to viewers )- those who don't know K is a big youtuber , done many researchers in physics and maths , a good singer , and at last writes his own poetries , books and novels <br /><br /> K : I am youtuber by profession as from there I started to earn money <br /> Researches in science and maths are my passion , singing is something close to my heart , which I do for relaxation whereas I write in free spaces <br /><br /> A : what did you just said free spaces , i guess you mean free time <br /><br /> K : no , I mean free spaces only , but it's the time of day which is not empty, can be used , but you mostly waste , it's not the time where you are relaxing , like travelling, bathing, time before getting sleep or something else. I mostly use that time to write <br /><br /> A: Hmmm , but I guess many people don't have this time on regular basis <br /><br /> K : If universe can have empty apeces then why not you <br /><br /> A : wait what ! What do you mean by that <br /><br /> K : it's just a hint I am giving to you and all the viewers ,, think by yourself,, why should I tell everything <br /><br /> A : Ohk ,, then can you tell about empty heart and empty feelings,, cause some people just sometimes feel empty without any reason <br /><br /> K : yes I know,, I also have gone through that face ,, when I was just 18 , for a large period of time,, at least once in a month I went through that empty feeling phase and at that time , the only thing I could do was to cry . It totally depends on you,, from what thing you get satisfaction,, do that ,, or just cry ,, so by this you would fastly get out of the situation <br /><br /> A : ohk ,, i guess it's enough for now ,, so let's end it ,, it was nice meeting you <br /><br /> K(smiles) : same here but wait ,, you asked out many questions from now let's play a game <br /><br /> A : oh wow ,, why not ,, which game <br /><br /> K : guess the golden ball <br /><br /> A : means <br /><br /> K(taking out 2 identical balls from pocket) : these are 2 balls ,, in 2 halves joint by magnet . <br /> One is golden and other is silver from inside ,, I will see what's in that and will push one ball further i.e according to me you should choose that ball for win ,, so you have to decide to choose the golden ball <br /><br /> A : oh that's a nice game ,, I will definitely try <br /> (Looking to camera) : you all also try to guess <br /><br /> K(seeing the balls from inside and pushing one of them ) : so choose <br /><br /> A(taking the unpushed ball) : oh that's silver one but I was expecting it to be golden one <br /><br /> K : Hmmm , I know what you were thinking,, <br /> You thought someone dumb will push silver ball further , you will choose the other ball, the smarter one will push golden one further to confuse you and you know it so you will choose pushed ball , the more smarter one will push silver ball to double confuse you and you think me to be that one so chose unpushed ball and I knew that what you were thinking about me so I pushed golden ball further and so you got tricked <br /><br /> A: damn bro ,, I am out of this game ,, let's end the interview <br /><br />

                    So after this interview was over <br /> We see K going home but he was on a cycle <br /> On reaching outer gates he had to place thumb on a device to scan <br /> Further on reaching the main door of house he had to answer few questions to enter the house <br /><br />

                    1st question was <br /> there are how many types of universe/ multiverse <br /> He answered : 3 <br /><br />

                    2nd question was <br /> Write 69 in terms of binary codes <br /><br /> And 30 seconds times was there <br /> So he fastly wrote 3,7,15,31,63 and then wrote 1000000 then changed it to 1000101 <br /> Then entered and it was correct <br /><br />

                    And the 3rd question which appeared <br /> Number of ways to write 18 as sum of any number of consecutive integers <br /> He answered 4 <br /><br />

                    And so the gates opened <br /><br />

                    ( Hey you the readers ,, if want to know the solution/process of any of them ,, message me after completing it) <br /><br />

                    After entering the house we see that on entrance there was a sink on right end with a mug to wash hands and on threshold there was area to wash feet through mug <br /> So he did so <br /> And entered the house <br /><br />

                    Then we saw that his 4 persons (one girl, 3 boys) came in the hall ,, and ask him about the interview ,, and so K told them whatever happened . <br /><br /> The girl was his wife named paki ,, rest were his friends , best friend Ursh and other 2 : raav and pray <br /><br />

                    After a little discussion he entered his room with his wife ,, further she asked so how is your research going on about the empty spaces of universe , <br /><br /> He replied, not really good <br /><br /> We all know everything in this universe is made of atoms and these atoms have some space in between them but what further,, nothing good is coming out but still I will try , <br /><br />

                    After eating food he went to his gaming room <br /> Where he earlier played games and made videos <br /> But he does this once a month ,, <br /><br />

                    Then we saw he saw time in his advance watch , it was 3:20:45 pushed 3 objects of that room , 1st one revolved 3 times , 2nd one 4 times and 3rd one at 225 degree but nothing happened , so he further rotate it to few more degrees , then an underground path appeared which lead to the basement <br /><br />

                    So he entered it ,, further he pressed a button which closed the gates <br /> Further he called hey steve , give the news of the 2 days <br /><br /> Further a robot out of nowhere came out and started speaking some researches which were published everyday from labs of different parts of the world ,, <br /><br />

                    Further he started swiping the news on left or right ,, after 10 -15 minutes of this act <br /> A screen got switched on and on that all the news which he had right swiped came on it <br /> Which were also split in the sections of medical, space , war , quantum, inventions , exploration <br /><br /> And he started analysis all of them one by one ,, after an hour later he stopped and pressed 'current topic' which was appearing on that screen <br /><br />

                    Further ' empty spaces ' appeared on that in large letters ,, <br /><br /> Further he said " statt discussion " <br /><br /> So steve came and said " yes sir " <br /><br /> K : as already talked about , everything in our universe has atoms and these atoms have space between them <br /><br /> Steve : yes , and these spaces are more or less depending on the type of matter , whether less or more <br /><br /> K : yeah , but are these spaces also made of something just like atoms are made of matter <br /><br /> Steve : antimatter , but according to scientists if matter and antimatter collided then an explosion is for sure <br /><br /> K : yeah but I can't understand that what I am Missing in all these <br /><br /> Steve : you could only find out only if you will think it yourself, <br /><br />

                    Further everything was silent , K was just thinking,, being pressure on his mind , analysing all the talks . <br /><br /> And suddenly he said 'a layer ,, may be' <br /><br /> With this he said to Steve , " analysis this all ,, I am going now" <br /><br /> And he went upstairs and out of the basement <br /><br />

                    Further to dining table , ate the meal with others , then to his room <br /> Layed down , along his wife was also laying , and a conversation between them started <br /><br /> Aaki : i wanna say something <br /><br /> K : you need not say this line , just say , whatever is in your heart <br /><br /> Aaki : I know , you are doing great things and I really support and appreciate them , but I really miss my original K <br /> I still remember the time where we met after a long time <br /><br /> K : yeah , I too remember we firstly met in 7th and when your left school after 8th we never saw or talked to each other <br /><br /> Aaki : hmmm and after 10 years when my marriage was going on and you were singing there unknowingly just for fun , when everyone was gone and I saw my fionacay cheating on me , and started attacking me when I caught him , you came and saved me <br /><br /> K : i would have done same , even there was someone else in place of you <br /><br /> Aaki : the thing I liked in you ,, and further when I entered this house ,, we first lived as just friends and after 3 years we realised to marry each other ,, <br /><br /> During those 5 years I had seen you like a normal guy with some perfections and some imperfections, but from around last 1 year you have just changed out a day mr. Perfect and the nex kit day .. <br /><br /> K(interrupting her) : no , please no , don't say anything further. <br /><br /> Aaki : okay okay , sorry, I know , you also can't do anything in that , but remember whenever feel you can just cry ,, <br /><br /> And yes I loved you , i love you and will always love you wheather you get changed or not <br /><br /> K : love you too <br /><br /> With this both of them sleeps <br /><br />

                    Next morning K was sleeping till late : around 11 am -12 pm : when woke , after refreshing ate breakfast , then got stuck on tv , further started watching reels on internet , moreover even after oily breakfast he started eating chips . Then got sleep which was just at random time <br /><br />

                    When woke up again eat (while watching reels) <br /><br /> And while day he was just saying everyone that please do this , please do that <br /><br /> Further he went sleep <br /><br />

                    But around 12 am when he felt everyone is asleep , he went to roof top and started crying , punching the walls , and saying, " why God , why " <br /><br /> Repeating this all , and just crying <br /><br />

                    Further we saw , Ursh was watching this all from behind and also had tears in his eyes <br /><br /> When K was coming back to stairs , Ursh quickly moved down stairs . <br /><br />

                    When Ursh had seen K sleeping , he went to statue of God his their house and started complaining to God ,, saying, " why God , what K bad has done in his life , why he is suffering from this pain , one day mr. Perfect and another day mr. Imperfect . And then at that night regrets that day , cause he wanted to save the day , but totally waste it , please God do something <br /> I can't see him in this condition anymore " <br /><br />

                    With this , Ursh went to sleep with tears in his eyes <br /><br />

                    Next morning K woke up early , did meditation , then moved out of house for his meetings and so regular day passed <br /><br />

                    Now some more days had passed with same routine <br /><br /> So after some days it was going a regular perfect day , he was in his research lab from morning 9 am . <br /><br /> Moving here and there , ordering Steve and finally at evening 6 pm (he didn't ate anything till now) <br /><br /> He published his thesis <br /><br />

                    The summary of his thesis was as such <br /><br /> As we know our universe is made of Matter and there are some theories that there are universes that are made of antimatter but he told that as we know there are empty spaces between atoms ,, so according to him these empty spaces are anti matter means that <br /><br /> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br /><br /> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br /><br /> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br /><br /> ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ <br /><br /> Suppose this is a body made of Matter,, <br /> Circles are atoms <br /> So if we remove circles and highlight rest of part , then that is anti matter <br /> And as some theories says if Matter and anti matter collide then there can be blast so according to him there must be a 2d or 3d plate or lining between both of them which would be neutral so named it as 'neutro matter ' inspired from the words neutrons <br /><br />

                    He also added some possibilities that how could we enter in it and what would we see in it <br /><br /> And some small details like once he was halusinating and saw something different while seeing moreover listed some glitches present in universe,, connecting them to his thesis <br /><br />

                    So finally he published it on his website where he also patent his thesis <br /><br /> And finally his thesis was open to the world <br /><br /> He was so much happy and excited after a long time he came out and told his friends and wife that finally he had done his research,, (having smile on his face) <br /><br />

                    He hugged everyone,, Everyone was making a little weird face <br /><br /> But his wife was still smiling but it was like she is holding her tears and said ," great work , let me bring sweets" saying this she went to kitchen with some tears in her eyes <br /><br />

                    When K asked everyone about their weird face <br /> Then Ursh answered in a sad tone ," bro , you forgot, today was her birthday" <br /><br /> K : oh shit , how could I <br /><br />

                    K quickly went to kitchen hugged paki , wished her , sayed sorry again and again <br /><br /> Paki stopped him and said ,"it's ok , if you forgot that today was my birthday,, but you know what from past many days I am just feeling you forget me " <br /><br /> Listening this K moved back <br /><br /> Paki : I don't needed any gift but I really need you , your time <br /><br />

                    K : so sorry , i agree I am wrong but <br /><br />

                    Paki : don't say anything , I know from what you are going through , I am saying this all because you completed your research and I had decided if today also you were like earlier i wouldn't say a single line to you ,, but making you realize that we all ,, your family,, needs you without any need ,, we love you and are Missing you ,, you really need to make balance,, at last from tomorrow if you follow your daily routine i wouldn't have a single complain , i will always stand with you whenever you will need . <br /><br />

                    Saying this she went to room <br /><br />

                    Next day when he woke up he saw many negative comments of his thesis, most were making fun of that , some were blaming him that it is copied and others doing something else ,, only a small percent was supporting him , his years of reputation got broke with this <br /><br />

                    He saw videos where some of his ideal scientists were saying that he is just wrong and impractical without and making fun of him <br /><br /> Some of people from different religion raging at him that if his thesis was true then any sign of that must been given in holy books of their respective religion <br /><br />

                    He started calling many people who he supposed to support him , but no one picked up his call <br /><br /> He locked the room <br /><br />

                    Paki , Ursh , raav and pray were seeing all the responses <br /><br />

                    Further When raav moved to K's room felt that it was locked , he knocked it , started beating shouting to make k open it <br /><br />

                    But K from inside replied,"no" <br /><br />

                    Hearing the noice all came and asked what happened <br /><br /> Raav told them every thing and they started pushing the door , making it break <br /><br />

                    As They entered they saw K sitting on a corner, head down and crying <br /><br />

                    They all moved to him , consoled him , gave water , <br /><br />

                    K : I was doing all of this for improvement in human race but this human race became against me , i lost connections from you all for while world , and this world made me lost from life ,, what wrong i had done <br /><br />

                    They took him to the hall <br /><br />

                    Tried to making him stop crying but again K started crying <br /><br />

                    Further K looking at paki <br /> Said , " i forgot your birthday , still you didn't blamed me ,, please scold me or beat me , i actually deserve this , I am so stupid that for others i forgot you " <br /><br />

                    Ursh(in a loud voice ): no K , you have done nothing wrong, yes you forgot her birthday, but this was just a small mistake, we can't ignore that before this year you made all of us feel so special each day wheather the day was ordinary or special <br /> So if everyone is making fun of you , then it's their fault ,, not yours Please don't blame yourself, i request <br /><br />

                    Rest of 3 also agreed with Ursh <br /><br />

                    K : love you all ,, from now I am totally yours ,, may all other go to hell <br /><br />

                    Interval 1 <br /><br />
